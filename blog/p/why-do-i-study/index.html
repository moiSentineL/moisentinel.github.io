  <h1 class="title">why do I study?</h1>
  <h4 class="excerpt">a realisation: transcending beyond the concept of scoring</h4>
  <hr>
  
  <h2>motive</h2>
<p>&quot;What is my motive to study?&quot;<br>
'No, it is not to score, but to learn.'<br>
&quot;Then why do I have <a href="https://moisentinel.github.io/blog/p/an-intellectual-dillemma/">inner conflicts</a> when studying?&quot;<br>
'I love studying. The issue is with &quot;why&quot; I am <em>supposed</em> to study. The most causal explanation I can give is that I put too much weightage on my principles <em>against</em> the &quot;study to score&quot; idea, which seeps into my mind when I am practicing and studying.'</p>
<h2>remembrance</h2>
<p>I would like to frame things differently to myself now. Instead of solving question papers for the best possible marks (which is inherently the objective behind mock tests and such), I will solve them to check my understanding and refine my knowledge (this aligns with my core values, which is to learn and acquire more knowledge.)</p>
<p>It won't matter if I score low. I would win <strong>inevitably</strong> if I learnt something new. And I believe that it <em>may</em> make me score more (I mean, if you are crystal clear with your concepts, how can you not score?).</p>
<p>But the main motive is to keep in mind that <strong>I am not doing it for the marks.</strong></p>
<h4>intentions</h4>
<p>Whenever I will watch a video on a concept or revise a topic, I would make myself remember my intentions of doing so. And they are:</p>
<ol>
<li>I love learning, and I will learn for the sake of learning (intrinsic motivation).</li>
<li>It will help me understand the world.</li>
<li>I can use it to contribute to the world.</li>
</ol>
<h2>wb college?</h2>
<p>Many students, including me, get startled when they think about college. &quot;Oh no, I have got to do X and Y to get into a good college!&quot;.<br>
I believe this is some sort of FOMO, but everything will be alright eventually. If you have your reasons clear, you are going to accomplish your job.</p>
<p>My parents worry about this too, because I am too &quot;away&quot; from the mainstream. This does not align with their ideology; well, they were raised in a different era and a different way.</p>
<h2>realisation</h2>
<p>I do realise that I had been in a slump. I had lost my curiosity, because I forgot my reasons why I study. Maybe this is high time that you too realise why YOU study.</p>
<p>Studying and learning should be fun, not mundane and aimless, which is why you need to understand what tickles your inner (studious) Laughing Buddha to wake up.</p>
