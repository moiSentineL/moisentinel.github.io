  <p>I've been thinking about this, as I brush off the dust from my parents' old point-and-shoot film camera. &quot;How cool&quot;, the tactile feeling, the tangibility. That feeling lost in the modern era as we start inclining towards smartphones capable of doing everything.</p>
<p>It's both a boon and a curse. Sure, people can now connect online, but it has created a distance among our close ones. I mean, it's not supposed do that. It's supposed to supplement our human relationships and serve as a tool for strengthening connections, not break them. Technology creates ease-of-access, but with an opportunity cost of emotions, commitment and deeper bonds.</p>
<p>The modern society is a consumerist society. In this age of high information and content and &quot;productivity&quot; one tends to slip into some eternal wormhole of &quot;more, more and more&quot;. But it is not the absence of ties, but the ties themselves. that set us free (Han). We must look forward to <a href="https://moisentinel.github.io/blog/p/the-idiosyncratic-era/#perception-and-rituals">ritualizing</a> our lives and think for a moment: &quot;Is it worth it?&quot;. We need to take a step forward towards being digitally minimal. A pause, a reversal.</p>
<p>A core concept of digital minimalism is to introduce friction and sort of &quot;dumb&quot; down off technology. That's why I started developing an interest to using an actual camera to take photos.</p>
<p><img src="../media/d47c6545b6c4e23d1353468831ffef0d.png" alt=""></p>
<p>It's the camera we bought in 2014 (not the one I mention in the first sentence; that was an old Kodak Kroma 35). And no, it doesn't take pictures as good as my phone, but the process of clicking pictures through it gives me pleasure. It's a romanticist feeling I cannot describe.</p>
<p>One more example could be writing with a fountain pen. As far as my observation goes, it has become obsolete nowadays. Ball-point pens are disposable, cheaper (but not in the long term), easy-to-use. Thus, the mass opts for such pens.<br>
<a href="https://moisentinel.github.io/blog/p/modern-era-and-connections">https://moisentinel.github.io/blog/p/modern-era-and-connections</a><br>
But using a fountain-pen has this unique process, the inking, accidentally getting ink smeared in your hands, the writing, the feedback from the nib. All these contribute to a personification of an inanimate object. For me, writing with a fountain pen is a pleasure that any pen cannot replace.</p>
<p>Maybe it's a temporary feeling (as my parents often say), I am not really sure! I feel as though I am trying to get involved with life and nature in a deeper way. But nevertheless, I am sure that I have to pause, live slowly with vigour. That's a rare thing to behold in this modern life.</p>
