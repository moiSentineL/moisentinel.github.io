<p>(2011) Myanmar was emerging from the choke-hold, opening up to the world at an ever-increasing speed. People started using phones, which were rarely used just a few years ago.</p>
<p>These phones, preloaded with Facebook allowed people to connect to the internet without much effort. And this was supposed to create a <em>connection</em> between the people of the country, and the outside world.</p>
<p>Facebook wanted to spread their services, thus gaining more ads and revenue from its increasing use in the country. Facebook was the prime source of information and that in itself was a major cause of concern...</p>

<p>Buddhist Extremists and Hate Speakers used that platform to spread hate for the Rohingya Muslims. And the Facebook algorithm <em>supported</em> it.</p>
<p>Because there was little to no moderation by Facebook in the ongoing activities, the posts spread like <strong>wildfire</strong>, like a contagious virus. And that led the extremists to <em>exploit</em> people's biases and feed them misformation. As a consequence, there are almost a million refugee Rohingyas whose country and people have failed them.</p>
<p>This ethnic cleansing was not directly caused <em>by</em> Facebook. It instead proved to be the catalyst in the reaction.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Availability_heuristic">Availability Bias</a></strong>: The frequency of such hateful speech and misinformation on Facebook was a <strong>lot</strong>. And because of that <em>availability</em>, people started believing in <strong>lies</strong>.</li>
<li><strong>Neglect from Facebook HQ</strong>: Because the admins ignored to moderate the algorithm in Myanmar, and instead focused on supposed &quot;growth&quot;, people conformed to the availability bias.<br>
This means that <em>misalignment</em> can be caused by inaction (of us humans).</li>
<li><strong>Lack of Fact-checking in algorithm</strong>: How will you classify misinformation if you don't check for it? And generally the algorithm doesn't do that (it cares about &quot;trends&quot;).</li>
<li><strong>Morality in Humans</strong>: Sounds like a good thing to discuss over a evening cup of tea.</li>
</ul>

<p>Myanmar was becoming a more &quot;open&quot; country, which meant that social connection and networking had to be established. And Facebook tried to do just that.</p>
<p>It was a sort of win-win situation. Facebook experienced growth, and the people of Myanmar enjoyed the unmoderated discussions and news that had the capacity to ignite a country-wide fire.</p>
<p>And people <em>wanted</em> to connect. International bodies too ignored everything that was happening inside and instead focused the good-looking outside.</p>
<p>Result? A failed algorithm driven by primitive social instincts.</p>
<h3 id="more-such-examples" tabindex="-1">More such examples <a class="header-anchor" href="#more-such-examples"><span aria-hidden="true" class="header-anchor__symbol">#</span></a></h3>
<ol>
<li>Anti-vaccine conspiracies</li>
<li>WhatsApp &quot;university&quot;: rumors, unscientific notions, only to confirm there preconceived notions (although it is more of a social phenomenon than a technical one?)</li>
<li>Misinformation during elections</li>
<li>Pandemic misinformation: consider every false information we got during COVID-19..</li>

<p>Technology for us, is equivalent to the fire for the <em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homo_erectus">Homo erectus</a></em>. It is helpful, but very, very dangerous if not used carefully.</p>
