  <p>Getting into a better shape is one of my main goals <a href="https://moisentinel.github.io/about/#this-year">this year</a>. And since my exams have ended (for now), I have the time and energy to properly plan and work on my health.</p>
<p>I am a person who exercises everyday, except for a few days when you just can't. I feel bland without it. I mean, I like working out. I feel good when the sweat comes out and my heart rate pumps up.</p>
<p>My objective is to build muscles and lose some fat. And doing unguided, random exercises are not going to be enough. That is why I was not progressing. So I thought that I should finally wipe off the dust from my dumbbells and start committing to a proper and proven routine.</p>

<p>I researched a few hours, and I found out that the best routine is to just start lifting (or any form of exercise). That is the aphorism. What I mean by that is, researching and finding the &quot;best routine&quot; won't help if I don't even work out. Procrastinating won't work either. It's better to <strong>just start with a beginner program, and stick with it</strong>.</p>
<p>But really, I found some really good guides and programs to help me out with weight training. The reason I chose weight-training over cardio (for fat loss), is for the long term. I want to preserve my gains and be fit for long term. (Check out <a href="https://thefitness.wiki">https://thefitness.wiki</a>; I am not really a fitness-geek.)</p>
<p>I am what you can call, a skinny-fat guy. I am neither over-weight nor under-weight. There is fat, and at the same time there isn't. I need to tweak my nutrition to help me with that, since most of &quot;being fit&quot; has to do with the kitchen. I think I will talk about it in another post.</p>

<p>I have figured out (most of) the routine. I am following the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/zc0uy/a_beginner_dumbbell_program_the_dumbbell_stopgap/">Dumbbell Stopgap</a> (yea, it does require dumbbells).</p>

<ul>
<li>Use the lightest weight at first</li>
<li>Up to 10 reps for 3 sets</li>
<li>1 minute rest between each set</li>
<li>Add weight when you can do 3 sets of 10 reps each (perfectly).</li>
<li>For the plank - 3 sets for as long as possible.</li>

<ul>
<li>Pullups/Rows/Dips are very essential to a program and I have added that to my workout routine. It wasn't present there originally.
<ul>
<li>Check out this video for <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZCxlfzslkQ8">places</a> to do those.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wr8ZA-cvH3s">Bedsheet Rows</a></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>On Day 1 of this routine, I found that it's important to <strong>perfect the form first</strong> instead of rushing on to more weights. Make sure you are doing the exercise with the best form.
<ul>
<li>Especially the Bulgarian Split Squats. I started doing Lunges instead. Will do BSS when I get more stability.</li>
</ul>

<p>This requires much experimentations, and I think I will keep giving updates on this.<br>
I am planning to do some low-intensity activities like light running, or some Yoga. Doing Tai-Chi is also very interesting, let's see where that goes...</p>
<p>And some HIIT (High Intensity Interval Training) 1x per week. I haven't decided on what to do <em>exactly</em>. But yes, This does sounds like a nice plan.</p>
<p>I want to emphasise more on the &quot;rest&quot; part of the rest days and avoid overworking. I really need to be more patient and control the urge, I guess.</p>
<p class="edit"><strong>Edit- Apr 5, 2024:</strong><br>
I have been trying out Tai-Chi for a couple of days, and it's definitely <em>something</em>. It's gentle and feels good. As one of my friend calls it, <a href="https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=based">based</a>.<br>
Thinking of ditching the HIIT plan and doing cardio- running/jogging 2x a week.</p>

<p>No really, it's time. It's really time to take health seriously. You and I both. And this is my first step to do so.</p>
<p>I will keep a log where I track my progress. I will jot down the time, reps, sets, etc. It will help me to reflect and be more conscious about my approaches. Plus, it is really important that I am regular with my routine. And considering that &quot;working out regularly&quot; is already a part of my identity, I can expand on that and produce some amazing results (I hope so, even though it is a long-term journey).</p>
<p>I just want to enjoy the process. And all the while, I will keep posting things related to it, the mistakes I did, the progress I made and all the stuff.</p>
<p>Well, happy being-your-best-self!</p>
