<p>&quot;Kilmer! KILMER!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Yeah mom, what's wrong? Why are you shouting?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Kilmer, you bloody bastard! You ate the damn pudding!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Wait, wasn't it for me?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;No, you dimwit! My boyfriend's coming over, and you ate the goddamn pudding!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;But, it's my birthday... I thought you'd-&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I don't care you little shit! You're gonna pay for this. Come here, boy!&quot;</p>
<p>I ran. I ran as fast as I could. I tumbled through cabinets in the kitchen, the couches in the rec room. From the corner of my eye, I saw my mom, well,<br>
my step-mom, chasing me with her black leather belt in her hands.</p>
<p>I reached the front door. It was locked.<br>
There was no way out.</p>
<p>I turn my back towards the door and felt her alcoholic breath on me.</p>
<p>&quot;Kilmer, boy, you're done.&quot;</p>
<p>I don't wet my pants anymore. After Dad, things got worse, and I guess just got used to it. I don't even know why I try to run. I know there's no saving me.</p>
<p>But there's always tears. Mechanical. Automatic. Tears.<br>
&quot;Mom, I'm sorry!&quot; I plead.</p>
<p>With one hand she pushes me against the door, and with the other she whips me. I close my eyes before the first whip. My senses come to a close. I imagine Dad and I at the park we used to go every Thursday, the bedtime stories he read me. I am at a safe place now. Nothing can hurt me.</p>
<p>The belt hits my thighs and calves one at a time. I wince. My mom cursing me every time she swings her belt. &quot;You idiot, you sick fucking child, you rotten piece of shit.&quot;</p>
<p>And then there's a loud thud. The whips stop for a while.</p>
<p>&quot;Mom?&quot; I call out. There's no answer.</p>
<p>I open my eyes to see my mom lying on a puddle of blood. Eyes wide open. I get close to her. &quot;Mom? Wake up, mom!&quot; I know she's not going to wake up. She's dead.</p>
<p>&quot;Yeah, she's dead.&quot; A voice calls out. &quot;We killed her.&quot;</p>
<p>I see a boy sitting on the couch. He has a blood-stained baseball bat in his hand. <em>My</em> baseball bat. He catches me looking at him, &quot;Well, that was supposed to happen sooner or later. I figured I'd help you out a bit.&quot;</p>
<p>The boy looks like me. He <em>is</em> me. But how do I know that?</p>
<p>&quot;You know that because I <em>am</em> really you, Kilmer, and you are <em>me</em>. Two sides of the same coin,&quot; he says, examining the bat in his hand. &quot;Come here and sit down with me.&quot;</p>
<p>Timidly, I do as he says.</p>
<p>He moves his eyes from the bat to me, &quot;You know I'd always protect you, right? I would never let anyone hurt you.&quot;</p>
<p>I nod, &quot;I know.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Good. But you see, there's no time to dance. We've got a problem in our hands,&quot; he says, pointing to the dead body with the bat. I follow the bat's direction. I see my abusive step mom, just lying there. Bloody. Contorted. Dead. The scene closely resembling the grotesque image of a pig beaten to death.</p>
<p>I can't stop my tears.</p>
<p>&quot;Hey, Kilmer, look at me.&quot; I look at him.<br>
&quot;Stop worrying. Nothing's going to happen to us. I got you.&quot; I nod. He touches my cheek, wiping my tears.<br>
&quot;We're going to handle this like we always have. And always will. Have you got that?&quot; he says.</p>
<p>&quot;Yeah.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Great.&quot; he snuffles and gets up from the couch, &quot;Because we're just getting started.&quot;</p>
<p>He walks up to the body, and looks at me.<br>
&quot;Sit tight, Kilmer. It's all going to be a-okay.&quot; And he smashes her skull to pieces.</p>
<p>&quot;GAAAH!&quot; he strikes it again. I can see the brain matter flowing out of her skull, and it makes me nauseous. I close my eyes. I take deep breaths. I don't hear his grunts anymore. My senses come to a close. I am being taken to a safe place now. I am going to be okay. Nothing can hurt me.</p>
