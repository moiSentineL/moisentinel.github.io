  <p>I love learning new tools and experimenting with them like a madman. Recently I discovered docker and tailscale, and oh boy...</p>
<p>Sure enough, I found myself diving deeper into the homelabbing culture (thanks reddit and youtube). But thankfully I have not yet bought an SBC (but I am desperate to get one!)</p>
<h2 id="docker-and-docker-compose" tabindex="-1">Docker and Docker-compose <a class="header-anchor" href="#docker-and-docker-compose"><span aria-hidden="true" class="header-anchor__symbol">#</span></a></h2>
<p>I use Arch. Things get messy. You run into weird dependency errors, <a href="https://aur.archlinux.org/">AUR</a> BS, and typical problems that you might experience with a rolling-release type Linux distro.</p>
<p>Then Docker came into my life. I had heard about it so much, but never bothered to try it out. What it essentially does is create isolated environments (called &quot;containers&quot;) for you to run your software on. Without <em>any</em> interference.</p>
<p><div class="embed-responsive embed-responsive-16by9"><iframe class="embed-responsive-item youtube-player" type="text/html" width="640" height="390" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/DQdB7wFEygo" frameborder="0" webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen></iframe></div></p>
<p>Docker and Docker-compose are basically the same thing, except that docker-compose allows you to manage your containers with a simple <code>yaml</code> file. It's quite handy if you want to get a lot of stuff running, like this:</p>
<p><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="/images/docker-ps-900w.webp 900w" sizes="(min-width: 650px) 1vw, 50vw"><img alt="docker" loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="/images/docker-ps-900w.jpeg" width="900" height="134"></picture></p>
<p>Just make a folder where you will store your <code>yaml</code> file and necessary configs, and run <code>sudo docker-compose up -d</code>. (Make sure to check tutorials before lol).</p>
<p>And v√≥ila, I now have my own music server (<a href="https://www.navidrome.org/">Navidrome</a>), <a href="https://jellyfin.org/">Jellyfin</a> which I can access from anywhere.</p>
<p>Wait, but how?</p>
<h2 id="tailscale" tabindex="-1">Tailscale <a class="header-anchor" href="#tailscale"><span aria-hidden="true" class="header-anchor__symbol">#</span></a></h2>
<p><a href="https://tailscale.com/">Tailscale</a> is (sort of) a VPN service that you can use to access your devices from anywhere.</p>
<p>So, what you can do is, keep your homelab at your home (duh!) and access it from that shitty bistro you visit every now and then.</p>
<p>All you have to do is connect to your Tailnet (that's the name for your Tailscale network) via the VPN (available on almost all possible OS's).</p>
<p>They also have this thing called <code>MagicDNS</code>, which allows you to type in the <em>nickname</em> of the device to access it, and you don't even have to type the IP!</p>
<p><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="/images/tailscale-magic-DNS-759w.webp 759w" sizes="(min-width: 650px) 1vw, 50vw"><img alt="magic DNS" loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="/images/tailscale-magic-DNS-759w.jpeg" width="759" height="545"></picture></p>
<p>You can also <code>ssh</code> into any device like that!</p>
<p>Just do:</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">ssh nibir@absurd
</code></pre>
<p>or whatever the device name is. Super cool!</p>
<p>Also... I found a cool workflow to use Tailscale:</p>
<h2 id="remote-music-production" tabindex="-1">Remote Music Production <a class="header-anchor" href="#remote-music-production"><span aria-hidden="true" class="header-anchor__symbol">#</span></a></h2>
<p>My producer friend lives 60kms away from my home, and we needed to make the song we've been putting off for 1.5 years. And since I am the musician and have all the setup, I needed my friend to take control of my PC and DAW and help me record and mix stuff.</p>
<p>But how could he do it? We also needed crystal clear audio. Latency on his side didn't matter as long as the quality was nice; he didn't need to record anything.</p>
<p>So, we set up a tailnet of our own, connected our devices and used <a href="https://app.lizardbyte.dev/Sunshine/?lng=en-US">Sunshine</a>+<a href="https://moonlight-stream.org/">Moonlight</a> to control the PCs. These apps were actually made for playing games from other devices, but you could do more than that, right? Like, making music!</p>
<p>That is how I discovered Tailscale actually- we were struggling to get Sunshine+Moonlight working, there was some problem in my router settings that I couldn't figure it out. So I said, fuck it, let's try Tailscale.</p>
<p>And it worked perfectly.</p>
<p>Sunshine+Moonlight was working great. There was very low latency, but of course you cannot expect a LAN-like 10ms from a relayed connection. Now, the next problem was my Linux system. <strong>Sunshine couldn't pick up the audio.</strong></p>
<p>That's where <a href="https://sonobus.net/">Sonobus</a> came in.</p>
<p>It's an open-source software for transferring audio from one device to another, and it integrates very well with your DAW. Just what we needed. <a href="https://www.sonobus.net/sonobus_userguide.html#Using-Your-Own-Connection-Server-with-the-Standalone-App">You can even host your own server</a>, and since we were using Tailscale, we could access it without worry.</p>
<p>So, that's how my friend and I recorded one part of our song. <a href="https://pillowcase.su/f/4ee3a8c2b320120877e84e3c9324573c">Listen here</a>!<br>
A lot more to do, but we at least we got something done!</p>
<p>Amazing experience. Though I have had to do some tweaking here and there. These reddit posts helped me.</p>
<h2 id="future-plans%3F" tabindex="-1">Future plans? <a class="header-anchor" href="#future-plans%3F"><span aria-hidden="true" class="header-anchor__symbol">#</span></a></h2>
<p>I wanna do a lot more with docker and tailscale.</p>
<ul>
<li>Host wallabag</li>
<li>Buy an SBC</li>
<li>Move Navidrome there</li>
<li>and use Pi-Hole</li>
<li>yada yada yada blah blah</li>
<li>and so on.</li>
</ul>
<p>Aah I will burn some of my money now.</p>
<p>Please feel free to send me some <a href="https://buymeacoffee.com/nibirsan">here</a>. Or UPI: <code>nibir@fam</code>.</p>
<p>Gracias!</p>
