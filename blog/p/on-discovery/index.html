  <h3>the art</h3>
<p>Once you start reading and writing, it all compounds into something much more, something greater. It all piles up to wisdom, to self-discovery and to attain a sense of tranquility and wisdom. Your writings are your life from a bird’s eye view, captured into pages, like the webbed information on the Internet. They are your thoughts, your belongings and you.</p>
<h3>the finding</h3>
<p>I feel much “able” and happy when I write, even though I acquired this knack very recently. I believe that, <em>the discovery of oneself is one of the most important and profound findings that one can have in one's lifetime.</em> And the craziest thing is that it never stops, and we’re constantly discovering something new about ourselves.</p>
<p>But above all, we should celebrate this sense of change and growth and cultivate a habit of recognizing ourselves.</p>
<h3>the influence</h3>
<p>According to Robin Waldun [1],</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>We are what we are because of multiple complex influences, many of whom we are not aware of.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>When we surround ourselves with the things that we love and are good for our upbringing, we are investing in ourselves. We are making sure a better version of ourselves. That is how we <em>create</em> ideas in us, and those very ideas are our identity, the certitude of our individuality.</p>
<p>Little by little we’ll build ourselves. And soon, after many years, we’ll begin to notice; a profound <em>change</em>. A cause of nature and oneself, after which one will try to move past it and do it all over again, without hesitation. <strong>A new perception, a new you and a new world.</strong></p>
