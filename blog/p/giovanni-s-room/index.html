  <p><em>Giovanni's Room</em> by James Baldwin was beautifully tragic. And it hit like a freight train. This book had me looking at love, humans and myself in a completely different light. I immediately felt the urge to grab my loved ones and say: &quot;Oh I am so very sorry. Oh I love you so very much!&quot;</p>
<p>I wouldn't dare classify this as <em>only</em> a romance novella; it's certainly more than that. It's about relationships, identity, sexuality, poverty, and the duplicit nature of humans. It's a tragedy, beyond tragedy itself.</p>
<p>I was, and still am, overwhelmed with feelings of longing, of sadness, of understanding and of <strong>love</strong>. I felt as if everything that happened in this book, was happening to <em>me</em>.</p>
<p>It's equally heartbreaking and sensual. I think it is a very, very important read for anyone. Imagine <em>Anxious People</em>, <em>The Fall</em> and <em>The Sense of an Ending</em> had a threesome and conceived a child with all of their qualities, but gay.</p>
<p>This post is a bit rambly and sporadic, because I cannot seem to string it all together. The feelings are really hard to put into words. But anyhow, here are my thoughts and inner reflections.</p>
<p>There is no literary discussion on this post, but I assure you that the language flows like sweet honey. It is very pretty. I read the print version along with the audiobook (read by Matt Bomer).</p>
<hr>
<p>It's terribly difficult to be a man who hides, who wants to remain <em>clean</em>, pristine, untouched, and unloved. He pushes everyone away. He is afraid. Afraid of everyone and afraid of himself.</p>
<p>Who would want to be that man? But you <em>are</em>. We <strong>all</strong> are.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;I have something to say to her- to her?- but of course it will never be said. I feel that I want to be forgiven, I want <em>her</em> to forgive me. But I do not know how to state my crime. My crime, in some odd way, is in being a man and she knows all about this already. It is terrible how naked she makes me feel, like a half grown boy, naked before his mother.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We are afraid of being honest, afraid of appearing without a mask in this costume party of a world. Fear does a lot of bad things to people, and to love.</p>
<p>This book made me understand how <strong>deep</strong> love is. How beautiful and yet, how cruel. It pushes you off a cliff and catches you at the same time. It is rapturous, treacherous, and oh how it makes you <em>thrive</em>. How it makes you <strong>live</strong>!</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;Look, <em>look</em> what you have done to me. Do you think you could have done this if I did not love you? Is <em>this</em> what you should do to love?&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Sure, love is complicated. <strong>But I'd much rather be in love than not</strong>. It may seem very naÃ¯ve- since I am only over 18, at the time of writing this- but love makes you whole. It anchors you.</p>
<p>It is a <a href="https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/pascal-wager/">Pascal's Wager</a>. Who wouldn't want to be in love?</p>
<hr>
<p>This book will make you terribly sorry for <em>everything</em>, but you won't know why.<br>
You may even cry, and you won't know why.</p>
<p>But linger onto that feeling of utter destruction for a while. Dwell on it, reflect on it, let it intoxicate you. <em>Feel it</em>.</p>
<p>And then, maybe, just maybe, we'll all understand some divine truth, about ourselves and about everything.</p>
<p><strong>4.5/5</strong></p>
