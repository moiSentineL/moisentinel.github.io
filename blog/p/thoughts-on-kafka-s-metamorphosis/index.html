  <p>Drudgery, duty and dreams of escape.<br>
That's what led to the metamorphosis of Gregor Samsa.</p>
<h2 id="spoilers-ahead" tabindex="-1">SPOILERS AHEAD <a class="header-anchor" href="#spoilers-ahead"><span aria-hidden="true" class="header-anchor__symbol">#</span></a></h2>
<p>In this story, protagonist Gregor Samsa turns into a gigantic insect when he wakes up from a good night's sleep.</p>
<p>We see him getting alienated by his own family, while he secludes himself to save them from pain. Whom he loved, turned away from him in a banal attempt to understand him.</p>
<p>Kafka's Gregor is a coward. Neither he protested nor revolted in his family's actions. He deliberately avoided pain. Some part of me believes it was his subconscious &quot;choice&quot; to transform and save himself from his duty to provide, yet in the story he is depicted as a good son who cares for his family and their needs. Nor does he protest being an insect. He simply accepts the fact.</p>
<p>According to the family, Gregor should've &quot;went away&quot; if he actually wanted them to live a good life. But Gregor chose to live under their roof. Why did he do that? Was he afraid of the world? Was he afraid that society would ostracize him, that he chose to confine himself?</p>
<p>The depiction of the relationship of Mr. Samsa and the transformed Gregor is a splitting reflection of Kafka's own experiences with his father Hermann Kafka, who &quot;believed in only the severest measures suitable for dealing with him&quot; (Kafka, 129).</p>
<p>The family, after Gregor's transformation sought work to earn a living, as Gregor was the one who gave them the money. His transformation, not only hampered his own ability to work or communicate, but also endangered his own family. He still wanted to provide for his family, but only made good-for-nothing promises to himself.</p>
<p>Gregor's sister Grete &quot;volunteered&quot; to take care of the transformed Gregor and his errands, yet could not bear to look at him. A distance and disgust soon entered between them as she chose to abandon him to have a better life for their family.</p>
<p>In the end, Gregor's existence was merely forgotten by his family who considered that it was a &quot;good omen&quot; that he died. Can we really think of it as a good ending when Mr. and Mrs. Samsa and Grete move into a different house and focus on living their life well? Are they wrong, or are they right? Should they not grief for their beloved son and brother?</p>
<p>But what led to Gregor's transformation in the first place? Does a Kafkaesque factor comes in play here? His work in his firm required him to travel and sale things constantly. He wanted to escape, but perhaps not like this. Was it immoral to neglect his &quot;duty&quot; to live a more content life. But it wasn't really his &quot;duty&quot;, he was just working a job which lacked any satisfaction and freedom to repay debts.</p>
<p>We're led to believe that Gregor's sacrifice was needed for them to be happy, and his demise was necessary. A sign of struggle towards reality, that the world is unfortunate.</p>
