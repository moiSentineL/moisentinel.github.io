  <p>First of all, we don't know if God exists or not. I don't think there's a way to prove it. (Descarte's way of finding god was in my opinion, buffoonery). But let's say away we found a way to prove that it exists. What changes will it bring? Perhaps people will start to ponder upon another question: &quot;<em>Whose</em> god is this?&quot;</p>
<p>What if it isn't what we thought all along? What if it isn't a supernatural, omnipotent, omnipresent, omniscient being? What if God is not &quot;God&quot;?</p>
<p>And what about the possibility that God is <strong>Evil</strong>? We haven't considered that yet, have we?<br>
I read about it for the first time in <a href="https://existentialcomics.com/comic/535">existentialcomics.com</a>, and then I discussed the topic with my friends.<br>
That question intrigues me. What if, really, God is Evil?</p>
<p>That would change everything, or maybe not. There are a few plausible outcomes: people will then stop believing in God, or blame others: &quot;It's YOUR God&quot; unlike if God was good: &quot;It's OUR God&quot;. Or something completely different altogether. Perhaps it will change their standards. &quot;Evil&quot; will become the new &quot;good&quot;, as jain put it.</p>
<p>It will turn out as a nightmare and existential crisis, if the God, which is evil, really made us. If it did, then did it make us all evil, a part of itself? Is this why violence comes naturally to us?</p>
<p>This is all a big IF though, since <strong>we don't really know</strong>.</p>
<p>Now, let us suppose we don't know if it exists (which we really don't; i.e, reality), does it really matter if it is evil, or good, or dumb? Maybe to me it doesn't, and to some rationalists, atheists, agnostics, EAs, etc. either.</p>
<p>But, the majority yet suffers. A banal attempt to put &quot;God&quot; in place of &quot;good&quot; and &quot;truth&quot;. They can't quite &quot;un-believe&quot; yet. It's their faith, their only solace, how could they deny?</p>
<p>The word &quot;God&quot; is created by man, interpretations are made by man, and confusions are caused by man. Well, bunch of rational creatures, aren't we?</p>
<p>It's something entirely different. We're just substituting. In my opinion, we're not capable enough to truly understand the gist. There's no way to conclude anything.</p>
