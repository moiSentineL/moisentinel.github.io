  <p>I am about two weeks too late to write this.</p>
<p>About two weeks ago, I finished The first part of <a href="https://amzn.to/3UElWTL">Basic Mathematics</a>...</p>
<p><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="/images/part-1-algebra basic math toc-500w.webp 500w" sizes="(min-width: 650px) 1vw, 50vw"><img alt="Table of Contents" loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="/images/part-1-algebra basic math toc-500w.jpeg" width="500" height="703"></picture></p>
<p class="caption">Table of Contents</p>
<p>...and I am really glad that I did (I know, clichÃ©.)</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="summary" tabindex="-1">Summary <a class="header-anchor" href="#summary"><span aria-hidden="true" class="header-anchor__symbol">#</span></a></h2>
<p>I had already read most of the stuff in Grade 9 and 10, so it was easy for me to grasp things. But I had to re-learn some of the things, as I didn't have a good foundation in some concepts. Thus, it was a great revision opportunity.</p>
<p>Chapter 2 and 4 were easy af. The three-variable linear equations were a <em>bit</em> new to me. I took my time with that.</p>
<p>Chapter 1 and 3 were the most impactful. I had to learn some proofs and theorems, which were pretty fun. I had some tough luck with inequalities, but they were pretty fun in the end. The interlude was pretty fun to read too.</p>
<p>All in all, reading this made me realise that this is <strong>not</strong> for the <em>complete</em> beginners; it requires a bit of basic math knowledge (kind of ironic, considering the book is named &quot;Basic Mathematics&quot; itself).</p>
<p>The language is not simple, but it is concise and clear in <em>mathematical</em> standards (not that I have read multiple math books...)</p>
<h2 id="impacte" tabindex="-1">Impacte <a class="header-anchor" href="#impacte"><span aria-hidden="true" class="header-anchor__symbol">#</span></a></h2>
<p>I was so interested that I even wrote a <a href="https://nibirsan.org/blog/math/why-a0-equals-to-1">blog post about it</a>. And <a href="https://nibirsan.org/blog/p/donald-s-im-mortality">another</a>, incorporating the things I had learned.</p>
<p>It helped me look things through the more <em>logical</em> side of the brain. Instead of being too &quot;algebraic&quot;, things were actually more on a physical plane in which you can move things and manipulate them. Something like arranging a physical puzzle, except you're working with proofs, theorems and equations. That's the best I could describe ðŸ’€.</p>
<h2 id="next-up..." tabindex="-1">Next up... <a class="header-anchor" href="#next-up..."><span aria-hidden="true" class="header-anchor__symbol">#</span></a></h2>
<p>The next part is called &quot;Intuitive Geometry&quot;, which will take that &quot;physical puzzle&quot; feeling to another level. And as I am writing this, I have already completed the first chapter... and it's interesting indeed.</p>
<p>And I've realised that I need to work on my geometric abilities. My &quot;intuition&quot; is a bit <em>off</em>. But I can definitely work on that.</p>
<p>More updates will soon follow.</p>
