<p>Kendriya Vidyalaya Mangaldoi.</p>
<p>After studying 10 years in this school (from Grade 1 to 10), I have experienced both the ups and downs of this school. And that is why, I am writing this. I believe that I can show the reader a different side of the commonplace. Moreover, I have an urge to resolve my qualm about the future of <em>my</em> school.</p>
<p><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="/images/school-review-439w.webp 439w" sizes="(min-width: 650px) 1vw, 50vw"><img alt="" loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="/images/school-review-439w.jpeg" width="439" height="159"></picture></p>
<p class="caption">my review from when I was in Grade 4</p>
<p>A lot of people give this school a 5 star on Google Reviews, and I believe there <em>are</em> reasons for that. But most of them are biased and not critical enough. We are people, we get influenced by emotions; but everything should have both the supporters and opposition.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Both optimists and pessimists contribute to our society. The optimist invents the airplane and the pessimist the parachute.<br>
â€”<strong>Gil Stern</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>In this critique, I will try not to give a biased opinion. In fact, I will be <strong>as critical and as honest as possible</strong>, because I believe it can, and will, contribute to the development of the school. This is a tribute to the time I have spent there and the time I will spend in the future.</p>

<p>There are three things that we must consider when analysing any system:</p>
<ol>
<li>The White</li>
<li>The Black</li>
<li>The Grey</li>
</ol>
<p>The White are things that are innately good about that particular system, and in our context, the things that are good about the school and the body governing it.</p>
<p>The Black are things that are bad about it. And the Grey are things that are out of the system's control or ours. The Grey is something that we <em>cannot</em> really classify as good or bad, they are complex, but they do <em>need</em> to be considered.</p>
<p>Here we will do just that. Keep in mind, I am just putting forward the things that I have experienced. You must try to form your own opinion, and not <em>solely</em> based on this text.</p>
<h2 id="2.-the-white" tabindex="-1">2. The White <a class="header-anchor" href="#2.-the-white"><span aria-hidden="true" class="header-anchor__symbol">#</span></a></h2>
<p>I believe that ANY school can give the student a great experience. It becomes a second home for them, a place to seek solace at times of dread. But what makes <em>this</em> school any special? Is it a <em>better</em> second home?</p>
<p>This school may not be as posh or &quot;hi-fi&quot; as some private schools, but that is the very thing that makes it special: this school continues to excel at many aspects. If you ask any KVian if s/he is proud to be the part of the Sangathan, s/he would never deny; and they continue to miss their schools after they pass out.</p>
<p>KV Mangaldoi provides an <em>experience</em> that <strong>no one</strong>, except other KVs can give. There is no replacement.</p>
<p>Being a student of a Kendriya Vidyalaya will give you many perks:</p>
<ol>
<li>The ability to participate in a variety of activities like sports, cultural, STEM and much more.</li>
<li>It is not only school-level (unlike private schools), it can be a platform where you display your skills in a <strong>state or national level.</strong></li>
<li>You have the opportunity to meet people from all over India, which is something the private schools don't usually provide.</li>
<li>From an economic standpoint, it is a bang-for-the-buck. It is completely worth it. A low fee and tons of features (since a school is also a consumer service).</li>
<li>The admissions are indiscriminate. Meaning you're not limited by your economic condition. You have a right to education, and you shall have it.</li>
<li>Competitive exposure: You are directly connected to the <em>centre</em> of the system, and so you get a lot of opportunities to participate in competitive exams such as IOQM/PRMO or Aryabhata Challenge.</li>
<li>Optimal infrastructure and facilities.</li>
</ol>
<p>There are also great things that are specific to KV Mangaldoi:</p>
<ol>
<li>There are a few teachers who are quite supportive and are always trying to nudge us in the right direction. They are great motivating and teaching us. We are always grateful to them!</li>
<li>When we need advice, we also have a counsellor who help us out in countering problems in academics and beyond.</li>
<li>There are a quite a few students who excel in their domains and are always achieving. From getting selected for National Level NCSC and RBVP, ISRO-held Young Scientist Program, to even publishing a book.</li>
</ol>
<p>And many more.<br>
Just ask any student. You will hear many good things about this school, and you must. Because this school is genuinely one of the best school in Mangaldoi. But it does have <strong>quite a lot of flaws.</strong></p>
<h2 id="3.-the-black" tabindex="-1">3. The Black <a class="header-anchor" href="#3.-the-black"><span aria-hidden="true" class="header-anchor__symbol">#</span></a></h2>
<p>What does a school consist of? Primarily students, teachers, parents and administration. The building and space is secondary. When we analyse a school, we must discuss those four things because it is sort of biosphere; they are interdependent and mingled. And often time, it is only <em>these</em> four factors that affect the zeitgeist of a school.</p>
<p>And by that logic, if there is a flaw, it is in these four factors. Let me repeat those: The students, teachers, parents and administration. And so, the Black of the school must come from them: the social parameters.</p>
<p class="edit"><strong>One side note:</strong> If any of my peers, junior, teachers, authority is reading this, kindly read with an open mind. I am not trying to defame anyone, I am simply pointing out the facts that can be used as a thesis to solve larger problems. Discussions are encouraged, not arguments.<br>
[improve]</p>
<p>Here is a detailed analysis of experience with each of the factors.</p>
<h3 id="3.1.-students" tabindex="-1">3.1. Students <a class="header-anchor" href="#3.1.-students"><span aria-hidden="true" class="header-anchor__symbol">#</span></a></h3>
<ol>
<li>There is little to <strong>no student enthusiasm</strong>. Even if there is, only a fraction of the students have it. Students do not want to bring a change and evolve; they are content with getting berserk over a games period.<br>
This is harmful. When the students do not try to initiate anything new, the output decreases. There is no more growth, only the same old stuff. Change must be constant, and students, or people in general, seem to forget that.</li>
<li>Which makes sense, because <strong>students have a lack of individuality and self-awareness</strong>. They are lethargic, dependent and apathic. They are spoilt and indulgent. Maybe it is related to the environmental and social culture of the place? Because I've seen overly active and aware students in other regions. (Refer to 3.3.2)</li>
<li><strong>Students do not collaborate</strong>. The only time they do is when the school organises CCA and Sports event. But it needs to go <strong>beyond</strong> that. Students need to unite when it calls for a change, they need to support each other, learn from each other instead of being arrogant. They refuse to contribute to their peers and the school they are in.</li>
<li>Even though there is a student council, the members often get &quot;chosen&quot; rather than elected. And the chosen ones, as I have seen, have done nothing. The council members only stand at their spots when they are told to do so. They are too busy studying for their 12th-boards and entrance exams, which in my opinion is a perpetual sacrifice of individuality. I'd rather not go into that <a href="/blog/p/an-intellectual-dillemma/">again</a>.<br>
Only a small fraction of students operate on their own terms, to do something good, and even extraordinary. That is clearly because <strong>students are directly or indirectly dependent</strong> on the teachers. Refer to 3.2.3 to see why. In fact, they don't even know how to study on their own until they are too old. I know it because I have seen my seniors settling for subpar learning methods. Mostly because of the lack of awareness for them.</li>
<li>And so, they <strong>rely on tuitions than focusing on schools and self-study</strong>. I've seen many people (even my friends) waste their time going to tuition for 1-2, and even 3 subjects. But when board exams came near, they <em>had</em> to do it all over again- <strong>on their own</strong>. No teacher would get you scores if you don't study on your own. I believe that self-study, <a href="/blog/p/5-things-youre-doing-wrong-as-a-student/">if done right</a>, can solve almost all the problems.</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="3.2.-authority-(teachers-and-administration)" tabindex="-1">3.2. Authority (teachers and administration) <a class="header-anchor" href="#3.2.-authority-(teachers-and-administration)"><span aria-hidden="true" class="header-anchor__symbol">#</span></a></h3>
<ol>
<li>The library was locked 70% of the time in 2023-24. Rarely were we able to utilise the resources to the best of our abilities. Why? The explanation given was, &quot;there's a lack of teachers, so we can't let you in without any supervision&quot;. Why couldn't the students step up and be accountable for themselves? And why couldn't the authority try to teach the students to be more accountable? In the core, <strong>students do not have autonomy and the students don't rebel.</strong></li>
<li>There must be a reason, right. Yes, few <em>unsavory</em> incidents did occur, which forced the authority to take harsh measures. Students were more restricted; there needed a &quot;supervisor&quot; for every situation, be that practicing for an event or even studying in the library. These <strong>authoritarian</strong> measures didn't make sense, at least to me. It's like a parent trying to restrict their kid from going out. Perhaps I am biased; there may be an other side to this. But this doesn't stop here.</li>
<li><strong>Spoon-feeding is a major problem in schools</strong>. Sure, a child needs to be guided and mentored until s/he attains maturity, but with an emphasis on promoting <em>independence</em> of the student, so that s/he can cope up with reality- that nothing comes easily. This spoon-feeding can be in many ways, such as prompting while the student is answering, giving instructions to almost everything, answers on textbooks (thus, this issue extends beyond authority), etc.<br>
Let students <strong>think</strong>. And let them think enough.</li>
<li>I understand that every teachers' teaching technique is different. But in my opinion, teachers, at best of their abilities, should use evidence-based, scientific teaching methods. For example, the use of flashcards, spaced repetition, quizzes, immersive experiments, etc.<br>
As I have observed, these &quot;special&quot; things are done mostly on inspection days; either the teachers have too much workload, or perhaps this aspect needs some time to actually evolve organically. [improve]</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="3.3.-parents" tabindex="-1">3.3. Parents <a class="header-anchor" href="#3.3.-parents"><span aria-hidden="true" class="header-anchor__symbol">#</span></a></h3>
<ol>
<li>The <strong>involvement of parents is very low</strong> in a <em>positive</em> sense. Only a few parents actually try to contribute to the development of the school. The majority just limit themselves to the societal notion of &quot;good marks = good kid&quot; and proceed to rant about how the school doesn't do X and Y instead of going to the bottom of the problem.</li>
<li><strong>Parents are misguided.</strong> In some places, people are really aware and understanding. But that is not the case here, and that reflects on the personality of their child. If you observe closely, people here lack the motivation at times. They could benefit from a bit more initiative.</li>
<li>I do understand that they too want their child to get good marks and have a good future (who doesn't?). But the reason, which I (and many of my peers) have observed <em>here</em>, is absurd: to <strong>compete with other parents</strong>. This happens. And this is not healthy. This leads the parents to become more self-centric and competitive and thus, they fail to see the bigger picture.</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="3.4-hierarchical-influence" tabindex="-1">3.4 Hierarchical Influence <a class="header-anchor" href="#3.4-hierarchical-influence"><span aria-hidden="true" class="header-anchor__symbol">#</span></a></h3>
<p>Apart from school-level administration, KVs are also influenced by regional-level and national-level administration. And most of the times, the schools are <em>required</em> to follow the orders sent by them.</p>
<p>Here are some flaws which the school gets from influence:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>The Student-Teacher Ratio in an average classroom is 40:1.</strong> This means that it is impossible for the teacher to engage in individual interaction and provide more <em>personalised</em> education (since every student is different). The teacher has no choice but to adapt to a <em>generalised</em> mode of teaching.<br>
There should be individual interactions. How else is the teacher suppose to analyse the student performance and their specific problems?</li>
<li>Call it fate, or bad luck, 3/5 of our subject teachers were transferred in October 2023.... and we had our pre-board exams in November. After this <strong>abrupt transfer of teachers</strong>, the environment got disrupted <em>completely</em>. Even if new/substitute teachers came, it was hard to bond with them over such a short period of time.<br>
This can sometimes lead to a bad performance of the student, and especially of those students who had been very dependent on the teachers (Refer to 3.2.3). The Sangathan should do something about this. Maybe transfer the teachers in the end of the session instead of the middle?</li>
<li><strong>Summer Break misalignment</strong>. The sufferers are almost all KVs in Guwahati Region. The summer break here happens during May-June. But the &quot;real&quot; summer begins in July. Even the state board schools have their summer breaks in July.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="4.-the-grey" tabindex="-1">4. The Grey <a class="header-anchor" href="#4.-the-grey"><span aria-hidden="true" class="header-anchor__symbol">#</span></a></h2>
<p>This is the factor which is out of our control. We cannot do much about it. The Grey includes things like institutional policies, societal notions, traditions, etc. It will take time to make progress in this sector, yet I want to point out a few things I don't like:</p>
<ol>
<li>The <strong>Indian Education System sucks</strong>. In fact, EVERY education system sucks, but ours sucks a bit more. Education system doesn't want the median student to do anything that s/he likes. S/he is supposed to achieve goals that isn't his/hers <sup class="footnote-ref"><a class="footnote-link" href="#fn1" id="fnref1">[1]</a></sup>.<br>
I have given up on it after seeing the NTA-NEET mishap, misconduction of CUET, JEE rat race, increasing suicide rates and so on.<br>
There is a lack of <em>freedom</em> and versatility in mainstream boards like CBSE and ICSE. These boards focus on making students good enough to crack exams, but not to live and think well.<br>
My only hope is that the <em>implementation</em> of NEP 2020 will solve things, which will take another 5-6 years. I hope that my younger friends don't have to <em>suffer</em> like us.<br>
For now there is no choice but to choose to be content:<blockquote style="align-items: center" class="twitter-tweet" data-theme="dark"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">We tend to complain a lot about the broken education system, but complaints don&#39;t recover the 6 hours per day we spend with it. Here are my tips to having a fulfilling school experience, from what I&#39;ve lived condensed into a guide I wish I had when I started high school: [thread]</p>&mdash; laura (@laurgao) <a href="https://twitter.com/laurgao/status/1513923401554964487?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">April 12, 2022</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
</li>
<li>I can rant for hours about this very problem- about how <strong>IITs and other institutions are just a brand</strong>. You get in, you get a special &quot;pass&quot; you can use to get high-paying jobs. This is a developing country. The govt. <em>wants</em> you to make money, promote industry. And all it is doing is making people money-making machines.<br>
<a href="/blog/p/an-intellectual-dilemma">I've written at length about this</a>.</li>
<li><strong>Society. It wants you to feel <em>little</em></strong>. It judges you every step of the way, never moving its eyes from you. It holds high expectations; yet, if you achieve that, people will feel jealous. Kind of paradoxical, isn't it?<br>
It sets up metrics: &quot;you have to get a good job!&quot;, &quot;eh? only 70%?&quot;, &quot;why are you doing B.A. in Philosophy? who will give you a job?&quot;, etc.<br>
No <em>rational</em> being would create such orthodox and misinformed notions in 2024. Quoting George Orwell, &quot;Orthodoxy is unconsciousness&quot;. This holds true for people even <em>beyond</em> the academic landscape in India.</li>
<li><strong>Education is a pay-to-win game</strong>. This is harsh, but <em>true</em>. Studying abroad will cost you your kidneys, studying in a private school will cost you your sleep. Freedom in academia costs money.<br>
For example, take <a href="#:xA-Levels-IB">:A-Levels (Cambridge) or IB</a>. Schools with these boards are only available on urban centers in India. And suppose you were a eager kid but have no money, you have slim chances of studying in such systems. This is only a single example, you can simply observe to realise that it is true.</li>
<li>And a lot more.</li>
</ol>
<p>Such situations make us feel that there's no point in escaping this &quot;cage&quot;, because there's always a bigger cage waiting. We should try to be content with it, and do whatever we can to make things better <em>within</em> our control.</p>
<h3 id="%3Ax-a-levels-ib" tabindex="-1">:x A-Levels-IB <a class="header-anchor" href="#%3Ax-a-levels-ib"><span aria-hidden="true" class="header-anchor__symbol">#</span></a></h3>
<p>These are boards/qualifications (like CBSE or ICSE) which put emphasis on knowledge, practicality and application rather than rote memory or &quot;exams&quot;.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="5.-conclusion" tabindex="-1">5. Conclusion <a class="header-anchor" href="#5.-conclusion"><span aria-hidden="true" class="header-anchor__symbol">#</span></a></h2>
<p>Okay, I have said enough.</p>
<p>I would like to remind you that this was by no means, a hateful remark on the school. This was based on <em>my</em> experiences to point out the things that might otherwise go uncovered...</p>
<p>...and also because <strong>I love my school</strong>. I want to improve it and contribute to it, and this is one of my few steps towards that goal. I will spend the next 2 years in Kendriya Vidyalaya Mangaldoi (I have taken admission for Grade 11), and I can't wait to see a <em>positive</em> change in the school.</p>
<p>I realise that there is a big difference between reality and dreams, but I dream big. I <em>really</em> want to see things change and go <em>beyond</em> the norms. But I cannot do this alone. I will need the support of many, many people- volunteers, active people, teachers, students, authority and much more, so that the <strong>dreams can become a reality</strong>.</p>
<p>May the force be with you.</p>
