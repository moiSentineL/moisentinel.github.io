I mean, who *likes* exams, eh? If they do, I really pity them.
Either way, no matter what I say or do, exams are inescapable with the current state of the world (education system). 

But there's no written rule that I cannot make it fun, right? I am allowed to integrate a menial, arduous task into something that matters to *me*. 

And what matters to me are **challenges**. I am a big fan of ideas like [Ultralearning](https://web.archive.org/web/20251110102618/https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/ultralearning/) and deep work. Taking on hard projects (both creative and scholarly) gives my life a purpose (at least that is what I think so.) 

So, I started the 30-day study rebellion - a multiplayer/communal challenge where I do study-with-me livestreams everyday and build a *community* around the grind. For 30 days, me and my warmates will study like maniacs, grinding till our asses turn red and then some. 

My goal is to turn studying feel like playing on a Minecraft SMP server. Studying can be super fun with friends, and with the exam season coming up, I felt that it was an excellent opportunity to do what matters: **bringing people closer** and getting some clout heheheheheh (ooh intrusive thoughts.) + it will be a great challenge to study, stream, survive, repeat, *every single day.*
