Here's how it goes:

-   We try
-   We die
-   We start again.
-   We go further this time.
-   We die again.
-   We go stronger.
-   We unlock new tools, new ideas, new guides.
-   Sometimes we meet friends. We talk. We get wisdom.
-   We die another time.
-   We are resurrected, and we begin again.
-   And so it goes, until we escape **hell**.

This is lifelong learning.

Every run makes us stronger. Every run teaches us something.
Life is a [Hades](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hades_(video_game)) run.
