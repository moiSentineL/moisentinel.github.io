Just sitting there
Plopped up on the swing set
Hooded and warm, that's me.
And a cup of coffee.
Time starts moving slow.

I resist the wave of industry,
To be and not do,
To busy myself not with work
But with the present,
The sounds, the air, the sights.

To do nothing, and feel everything
The spirit of the moment seeping in me
With every mindful sip.
And stillness sprouts with merry laughter.

Doing nothing has never felt so good.
