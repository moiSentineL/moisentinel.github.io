title: Why does a^0 equal to 1?
---
This is silly. Everybody knows $a^{0}= 1$. But why?

I didn't know the answer to this question. And that's very dumb. I kept questioning because it *didn't* make sense to me:

"When we multiply something with 0, it equals to 0, right? Doesn't $a^0$ mean that there are 0 $a$?"

And all sort of things, which do not make sense.

But I finally knew the logical and *algebraic* answer.

We'll need to understand a law of exponent first:
$$
\begin{gathered}
a^{m+n}=a^{m}a^{n}
\end{gathered}
$$

Now that we understand, let's prove that $a^{0}=1$
### Proof

Well, I gotta learn how to write LaTeX efficiently. Until then, consider doing a handwriting recognition course.

This was a very simple thing, but I wanted to share it. 

Alright, happy solving!
