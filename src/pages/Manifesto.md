This is my Manifesto of Living.

- Delay gratification.
- Happiness comes from deep, long, focused, and single-tasked sessions, and not shallow drifting. Deep work is what matters.
- Only a thought we've *lived* has any value.
- To live without distractions, to stop and notice.
- To pick the simplest solution and discard the rest.
- High effort should lead to high yields, else we don't do it.
- Embrace boredom.
- **Be**. A state of being cognition gives you real happiness.
