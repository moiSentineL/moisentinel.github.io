## Who am I, you ask?

I am an awareness trapped in a human body passing through space and time. Or maybe a dimension-spanning, time-travelling duck. Who knows?

But to be specific:

I am a senior high-schooler from India who thrives to learn new things, improve everyday and **create** stuff that matters. And currently, I am working on mastering my mindset so that I can unlock my true potential.

I am interested in [polymathy](/blog/p/another-renaissance) + autodidactism, [ultralearning](https://web.archive.org/web/20251110102618/https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/ultralearning/), [community](https://discord.gg/KuERYwWmkG) building, [working out](/workout/), [math](https://math.nibirsan.org), and creating a "deep life" among many (see below!). I love talking to new people, reading, playing music, writing and doing ultralearning projects in my free time.

[See what I have been upto recently](/now/).

I am someone who likes thinking *very* much. I love dwelling on philosophical questions and descending into madness, though recently I've realised that *living* a thought is more important than just pondering on it.

I am curious person, and I am not afraid to experiment and possibly break a few things to scratch my intellectual and creative itches. But there's a limit to how much should break before I call it quits and return to a stable state.

I like doing a lot of things: [reading](/blog/books/), [philosophy](/phil/), livestreaming and making videos (check my [YouTube!](run.nibirsan.org/yt)), [writing](/blog/), [open-sourcing](https://run.nibirsan.org/gh), playing and producing music, and the list goes on. **But there's only one end goal. That is, to do something that actually matters, to create *meaningful* stuff.** See [projects](/projects/) to see proof.

I love my work ethic, the process of *creation* and the endorphins it releases, though I can be a *bit* workaholic and too ambitious at times. Aah, the never-ending Apollonian vs Dionysian fight.

My philosophy is inspired by:
- Stoicism (normative)
- Digital Minimalism ∧ Deep Work 
- James Scholz (tech)
- Doing things that matter (prioritization)
- Nietzsche
- Ultralearning

I appreciate updating my beliefs and trying to improve myself by intensely introspecting myself. 

Here are some more things I like:
- Linux / Unix
- <s>Obsidian</s> Emacs
- Fountain pens and notebooks
- Coffee (making and drinking both!)
- Building better systems (atomic habits style)
- Memory / SRS
- Engaging in deep and genuine conversations with people
- Meditating
- Optimising my learning pattern
- Playing games (ooh Disco Elysium is sick!)

So, in short, **I am a scholar, a builder and a person who improves everyday**.

## What's cooking this year

My main themes for this year (2025) are:

- **Work**: Focusing on both formal education and self education
	- [math grind](https://nibirsan.org/war-of-becoming/projects/project-math-machine/)
- **Health**: Creating better systems
	- via habits, ritualisation and tracking
- **Relationships**: Accepting family responsibilities and be closer to parents
- **Personal Growth**: Seeking the virtuous life
	- imo "virtuous" = stoicism + minimalism + prioritisation + absurdism)

Goals and Habits for each theme will be implemented on Quarterly and Weekly basis. The themes are inspired by Stoicism and the want to improve myself and how I handle things.

## The flexing part

Just kidding, there ain't no flexing here.
