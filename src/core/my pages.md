This is the collection of my **"evergreen"** notes or pages. They grow as *I* grow.

The pages are a reflection of who I am as a person, my beliefs and philosophy that I live by. If my blogposts are the "weather", then these pages are the climate.

These might also give you some ideas or information in specific cases like using a homemade [philosophy curricula](/phil/), or [study resources](/resources/).

(work in progress, forever.)
