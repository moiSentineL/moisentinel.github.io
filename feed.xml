        <content xml:lang="en" type="html">&lt;p&gt;A wave of pessimistic rage reaches their shores,&lt;br /&gt;
Will I find solace if I keep sailing my boats?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I curse the land and its inhabitants&lt;br /&gt;
Their bellies full of tar and hearts full of money,&lt;br /&gt;
Gluttony, greed and lust,&lt;br /&gt;
Mankind defined by their inhumanity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let the devil take them&lt;br /&gt;
And make deals with me,&lt;br /&gt;
I shall sell my soul to set my seas free;&lt;br /&gt;
But I wonder if I have the courage,&lt;br /&gt;
To suffer being nailed, guiltily.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am insignificant,&lt;br /&gt;
With my own incompetence&lt;br /&gt;
And my own ignorance;&lt;br /&gt;
For what credential do I claim to be their king?&lt;br /&gt;
I am too, trapped in the depths of consciousness&lt;br /&gt;
In solitude and uncertainty I cling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But righteous we are and how I feel,&lt;br /&gt;
My crew minimal yet strong,&lt;br /&gt;
Are ready to turn the wheel&lt;br /&gt;
Of time, space and reality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As the wave of pessimistic quietness stills the sand,&lt;br /&gt;
I grab the cannons and fire upon their optimistic land.&lt;/p&gt;

          understanding the unconscious mind via Jung&#39;s Word Association.

        <content xml:lang="en" type="html">&lt;h2 id=&quot;a-deep-dive&quot; tabindex=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;A deep dive &lt;a class=&quot;header-anchor&quot; href=&quot;https://moisentinel.github.io/blog/p/deep-down-the-iceberg/#a-deep-dive&quot;&gt;&lt;span aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot; class=&quot;header-anchor__symbol&quot;&gt;#&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The beginning of 20th Century marked the start of the never-ending deep dive to understand ourselves. In 1900, Austrian neurologist Sigmund Freud published &lt;strong&gt;The Interpretation of Dreams&lt;/strong&gt;, the first attempt at theorising the &amp;quot;unconscious&amp;quot; mind. He believed that the unconscious mind contains some of the deepest secrets of an individual. Dreams, as he thought, were a way the unconscious mind reveals itself. Freud sought out to understand it, and solve his patients&#39; problems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Freud developed the Free Association method as the alternative to the hypnotic method to help his patients. Basically, the patient rambles on about anything, no matter how embarrassing or incoherent it may be. But it needs to be honest.&lt;sup class=&quot;footnote-ref&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;footnote-link&quot; href=&quot;https://moisentinel.github.io/blog/p/deep-down-the-iceberg/#fn1&quot; id=&quot;fnref1&quot;&gt;[1]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; No prompting or intervention is done by the analyst. The patient could talk about their dreams (Dream Interpretation), or thoughts, memories, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Later, the analyst analyses the information and finds the source of &amp;quot;conflict&amp;quot;. Free associations reveal the connections in the unconscious that might otherwise go uncovered.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;His Swiss counterpart Carl Jung thought that this takes up a lot of time, and that efficacy also depended on the chemistry of the patient and analyst (whether they were comfortable or not). He developed the Word Association test with his colleague.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;picture&gt;&lt;source type=&quot;image/webp&quot; srcset=&quot;/images/Carl Jung_comp-300w.webp 300w, /images/Carl Jung_comp-500w.webp 500w&quot; sizes=&quot;(min-width: 650px) 1vw, 50vw&quot; /&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;Carl Jung&quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; decoding=&quot;async&quot; src=&quot;https://moisentinel.github.io/images/Carl%20Jung_comp-300w.jpeg&quot; width=&quot;500&quot; height=&quot;616&quot; srcset=&quot;/images/Carl Jung_comp-300w.jpeg 300w, /images/Carl Jung_comp-500w.jpeg 500w&quot; sizes=&quot;(min-width: 650px) 1vw, 50vw&quot; /&gt;&lt;/picture&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;caption&quot;&gt;Carl Gustav Jung c. 1935&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In that test,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There are 100 words, which the analyst prompts to the patient.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The patient is to speak whatever comes to their mind first, when they are prompted a word.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The patient is &lt;strong&gt;not&lt;/strong&gt; delay speaking.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The patient is to be honest.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jung&#39;s technique differs from Freud&#39;s in a few ways.&lt;br /&gt;
Freud&#39;s involved no prompting, but Jung&#39;s does. Free Association is more free-formed, but Word Association is more structured and robust. But both of the techniques are meant to understand the deeper self.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;how-does-it-work%3F&quot; tabindex=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;How does it work? &lt;a class=&quot;header-anchor&quot; href=&quot;https://moisentinel.github.io/blog/p/deep-down-the-iceberg/#how-does-it-work%3F&quot;&gt;&lt;span aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot; class=&quot;header-anchor__symbol&quot;&gt;#&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;screen-reader-only&quot;&gt;Direct link to this section&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If the responses are absurd or delayed, it suggests a cause of concern. For example, if I hesitated in replying for the word &amp;quot;milk&amp;quot; or said something &lt;em&gt;peculiar&lt;/em&gt;, that means something is wrong between me and milk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Word Association test helps in uncovering emotionally charged complexes, patterns and suppressed thoughts, which are identified by the time taken to respond and the response itself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The delays and startles by the patient suggest a conflict between parts of the self. One part (unconscious) wants to speak and other (conscious) wants to stay silent.&lt;sup class=&quot;footnote-ref&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;footnote-link&quot; href=&quot;https://moisentinel.github.io/blog/p/deep-down-the-iceberg/#fn2&quot; id=&quot;fnref2&quot;&gt;[2]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

P: This is RIDICULOUS, Dr. A! I am not going to pay for this session! &lt;em&gt;Proceeds to walk out&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We can also test it on ourselves by recording the time taken for responses and analyse it ourselves, although I don&#39;t know how credible it would be. You might as well find something weird about yourself! Talk about self-awareness!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Free Association is still used in modern psychoanalytic practices, but not in it&#39;s pure form.&lt;sup class=&quot;footnote-ref&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;footnote-link&quot; href=&quot;https://moisentinel.github.io/blog/p/deep-down-the-iceberg/#fn3&quot; id=&quot;fnref3&quot;&gt;[3]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; Many variations have been created, which include more instructions by the analyst and are more standardised.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Word Association test is used by Kabir in the movie Zindagi Na Milegi Dobara (2011) to &amp;quot;get to the roots&amp;quot; of Imran&#39;s dilemma. Although, Arjun refers to Kabir as &amp;quot;Dr. Sigmund &lt;em&gt;Fraud&lt;/em&gt;&amp;quot;, which can mean two things: either Arjun didn&#39;t know about Jung&#39;s theory, or Jung is yet again undermined by Freud&#39;s popularity.&lt;/p&gt;

        <id>https://moisentinel.github.io/blog/p/into-the-nativity/</id>
        <content xml:lang="en" type="html">&lt;h2 id=&quot;when-he-neglects&quot; tabindex=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;when he neglects &lt;a class=&quot;header-anchor&quot; href=&quot;https://moisentinel.github.io/blog/p/into-the-nativity/#when-he-neglects&quot;&gt;&lt;span aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot; class=&quot;header-anchor__symbol&quot;&gt;#&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;screen-reader-only&quot;&gt;Direct link to this section&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have spent more or less 10 years of my life neglecting Assamese. I wasn&#39;t too keen with its grammar and literature even though it&#39;s the language I use for communication on a daily basis. I hate to admit, but I considered Assamese as an &amp;quot;inferior&amp;quot; language. I considered my own mother tongue to be &amp;quot;poor&amp;quot;. Never have I ever was so ashamed of making a statement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maybe it was due to my compassion towards English and western lifestyle, maybe I had just taken it for granted or maybe I was ignoring my ignorance. I didn&#39;t &amp;quot;connect&amp;quot; with my own tongue. It slipped forgotten and remained there in the corner, full of dust, until last year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Professor Khadane is one of the most brilliant people I have ever met. He had this &lt;em&gt;thing&lt;/em&gt;, he made people question reality (so mind-boggling he was). People in academia are kind of weird. He told us to read in our mother tongue, and that only through it we can understand wholly and become good humans. And I thought, &amp;quot;huh, maybe I should try it.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This was all before I was into any of this: writing wasn&#39;t my &lt;a href=&quot;https://moisentinel.github.io/blog/p/i-am-an-addict&quot;&gt;passion&lt;/a&gt;, philosophy was an adversary. Those days I spent in the IIST Campus were of contemplation and revelations. I understood a little more about what I want.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;

        &lt;span class=&quot;screen-reader-only&quot;&gt;Direct link to this section&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fast forward to the last quarter of 2023,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I started to read Assamese, and thankfully, I knew enough to read it (or else I would&#39;ve been a &lt;a href=&quot;https://genius.com/Queen-we-will-rock-you-lyrics#:~:text=You-,big%20disgrace,-Kicking%20your%20can&quot;&gt;big disgrace&lt;/a&gt;, eh?). I just had some problems while writing it. I wrote Assamese as frequently as I would take deworming medicines (i.e., very rarely).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I started reading those weekly regional newspapers, perhaps later that year, and they had short stories at the end. I liked them very much.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After taking some time to explore outside of the end-pages, I was baffled to see translated texts of English literature, philosophical talks (which I was getting into, in English). And suddenly, I felt proud. There was a sense of belonging. My ideas converged with my nativity. I was highly influenced by them. The ambition to create a &lt;a href=&quot;https://moisentinel.github.io/blog/p/another-renaissance&quot;&gt;movement&lt;/a&gt; came from reading a few articles there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Soon, my mother got me some books that were packed my Grandma&#39;s trunk. I was so amazed to see them. I picked one up and started reading it. It was &amp;quot;Bohnisikha&amp;quot; (Rain of Fire) by Ranju Hazarika, a sci-fi apocalyptic tale. It was interesting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Things changed when I picked up Jayanta Patowary&#39;s &amp;quot;Buddhijibir Atmasamarpan&amp;quot;(Intellectual&#39;s Surrender). It had themes like morality, modernity and its cons, society, intellectualism, people, etc. And man, it gave me a surreal experience. I didn&#39;t feel that it was written about 20 years ago; it felt as though it was written so recently. I want to translate it sometime.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, I feel this sense of connection and it&#39;s not explainable. I am learning new vocabulary and I feel grateful to have finally learn the real &lt;strong&gt;value&lt;/strong&gt; of it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One really shouldn&#39;t neglect their own language, their legacy. I want to live to see our generation, especially the ones living in urban areas to carry on our cultural heritage. It is crucial and indispensable.&lt;/p&gt;

        <content xml:lang="en" type="html">&lt;p&gt;Drudgery, duty and dreams of escape.&lt;br /&gt;
That&#39;s what led to the metamorphosis of Gregor Samsa.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;spoilers-ahead&quot; tabindex=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;SPOILERS AHEAD &lt;a class=&quot;header-anchor&quot; href=&quot;https://moisentinel.github.io/blog/p/thoughts-on-kafka-s-metamorphosis/#spoilers-ahead&quot;&gt;&lt;span aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot; class=&quot;header-anchor__symbol&quot;&gt;#&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;screen-reader-only&quot;&gt;Direct link to this section&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this story, protagonist Gregor Samsa turns into a gigantic insect when he wakes up from a good night&#39;s sleep.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We see him getting alienated by his own family, while he secludes himself to save them from pain. Whom he loved, turned away from him in a banal attempt to understand him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kafka&#39;s Gregor is a coward. Neither he protested nor revolted in his family&#39;s actions. He deliberately avoided pain. Some part of me believes it was his subconscious &amp;quot;choice&amp;quot; to transform and save himself from his duty to provide, yet in the story he is depicted as a good son who cares for his family and their needs. Nor does he protest being an insect. He simply accepts the fact.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to the family, Gregor should&#39;ve &amp;quot;went away&amp;quot; if he actually wanted them to live a good life. But Gregor chose to live under their roof. Why did he do that? Was he afraid of the world? Was he afraid that society would ostracize him, that he chose to confine himself?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The depiction of the relationship of Mr. Samsa and the transformed Gregor is a splitting reflection of Kafka&#39;s own experiences with his father Hermann Kafka, who &amp;quot;believed in only the severest measures suitable for dealing with him&amp;quot; (Kafka, 129).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The family, after Gregor&#39;s transformation sought work to earn a living, as Gregor was the one who gave them the money. His transformation, not only hampered his own ability to work or communicate, but also endangered his own family. He still wanted to provide for his family, but only made good-for-nothing promises to himself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gregor&#39;s sister Grete &amp;quot;volunteered&amp;quot; to take care of the transformed Gregor and his errands, yet could not bear to look at him. A distance and disgust soon entered between them as she chose to abandon him to have a better life for their family.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the end, Gregor&#39;s existence was merely forgotten by his family who considered that it was a &amp;quot;good omen&amp;quot; that he died. Can we really think of it as a good ending when Mr. and Mrs. Samsa and Grete move into a different house and focus on living their life well? Are they wrong, or are they right? Should they not grief for their beloved son and brother?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But what led to Gregor&#39;s transformation in the first place? Does a Kafkaesque factor comes in play here? His work in his firm required him to travel and sale things constantly. He wanted to escape, but perhaps not like this. Was it immoral to neglect his &amp;quot;duty&amp;quot; to live a more content life. But it wasn&#39;t really his &amp;quot;duty&amp;quot;, he was just working a job which lacked any satisfaction and freedom to repay debts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We&#39;re led to believe that Gregor&#39;s sacrifice was needed for them to be happy, and his demise was necessary. A sign of struggle towards reality, that the world is unfortunate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;8/10.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

          emptiness and getting back on track
        </summary>
        <updated>2024-03-12T11:10:07Z</updated>
        <id>https://moisentinel.github.io/blog/p/so-what-now/</id>
        <content xml:lang="en" type="html">&lt;p&gt;The moment I had been waiting for, is finally here. My exams ended yesterday (11th March), and now I have been successfully freed from my cage and put into a bigger one!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I had been fantasizing for this moment for so long, &amp;quot;Oh yeah, it would be so good I can&#39;t wait!&amp;quot;. Yet, now I feel empty. I feel purposeless. I miss those inner conflicts and mental breakdowns. Classic example of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.britannica.com/science/Stockholm-syndrome&quot;&gt;Stockholm Syndrome&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am satisfied with the end. It was tragic yet amiable. I was both happy and sad at the same time. Not so long ago, I was furious and angry at myself for not being able to study, pointing out the very fact that exams are good for nothing. But I had found a purpose (yes finally.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the end of February, I had made up my mind that I would start doing those James Scholz-style Study-With-Me livestreams on YouTube. I was aware of the Hawthorne Effect and I thought to try it out. And surprisingly, it went well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What I discovered was more than being accountable to the viewers. I felt that I was helping people. Helping them focus, helping them not feel alone. Board exams are kind of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/CBSE/comments/1at5pdm/why_are_boards_so_fucking_overhyped/&quot;&gt;overhyped&lt;/a&gt; in India, so millions of students every year feel stressed out. They go through inner conflicts and mental breakdowns too. It was great to talk to many people (most of them trolls, btw), and improve my communication skills. Speaking in front of a camera is a skill one should have (before they go on to the stage?)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That&#39;s what made me a victim of Stockholm Syndrome. Is being helpful counter-productive? Well, at least now I know that I like making content on video and just talking to people about the stuff that I talk about here and on my &lt;a href=&quot;https://visionoflife.substack.com/&quot;&gt;newsletter&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Btw, my exams went well ;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&#39;s time to reset my priorities and sort out my long bucket-list.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What I am chasing now is new experiences, new perspective to see this world and some cold hard facts that&#39;ll make me humble. And I know some things might not work, but I am willing to try them all out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have almost three-months spare to do a lot of things. I&#39;ll finally finish reading my TBR and get over my writer&#39;s block. I&#39;ll finally revamp my Personal Knowledge Management system. I&#39;ll finally dedicate more time to myself, my family and my friends. Some trips and travels and a romanticist approach to life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was reading this amazing &lt;a href=&quot;mailto:reader-forwarded-email/cb49c04bfbf10b888cb736ab150890ab&quot;&gt;article&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/@RCWaldun&quot;&gt;Robin Waldun&lt;/a&gt;, it had a line:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;If we ever lose the giddiness when we notice something new, can we still call what we’re living &lt;strong&gt;life&lt;/strong&gt;?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oh no, no, we need that. We need to feel giddy, we need to feel the emotions that arise from it. We need to observe and experience. Down with monotonous-ness of modern life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Just now, as I raced across the street, stomping in the mud to get through that chaos in motion where death gallops at you from all sides at once, my halo slipped off my head and onto the filthy ground… And then I said to myself, look for the silver lining. I can now walk around incognito, doing whatever nasty things I like, indulging my vices just as lesser mortals do. And here I am, just like you, as you see!”&lt;br /&gt;
-Charles Baudelaire&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The silver lining is that I can do whatever I want now. Struggle, feel the pain, remember the absurd, and have a great time with my life. I am now getting back on track.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another change, another thing to be grateful for.&lt;/p&gt;

          the problem with technological advancements
        </summary>
        <updated>2024-03-06T15:55:08Z</updated>
        <id>https://moisentinel.github.io/blog/p/modern-era-and-connections/</id>
        <content xml:lang="en" type="html">&lt;p&gt;I&#39;ve been thinking about this, as I brush off the dust from my parents&#39; old point-and-shoot film camera. &amp;quot;How cool&amp;quot;, the tactile feeling, the tangibility. That feeling lost in the modern era as we start inclining towards smartphones capable of doing everything.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&#39;s both a boon and a curse. Sure, people can now connect online, but it has created a distance among our close ones. I mean, it&#39;s not supposed do that. It&#39;s supposed to supplement our human relationships and serve as a tool for strengthening connections, not break them. Technology creates ease-of-access, but with an opportunity cost of emotions, commitment and deeper bonds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The modern society is a consumerist society. In this age of high information and content and &amp;quot;productivity&amp;quot; one tends to slip into some eternal wormhole of &amp;quot;more, more and more&amp;quot;. But it is not the absence of ties, but the ties themselves. that set us free (Han). We must look forward to &lt;a href=&quot;https://moisentinel.github.io/blog/p/the-idiosyncratic-era/#perception-and-rituals&quot;&gt;ritualizing&lt;/a&gt; our lives and think for a moment: &amp;quot;Is it worth it?&amp;quot;. We need to take a step forward towards being digitally minimal. A pause, a reversal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A core concept of digital minimalism is to introduce friction and sort of &amp;quot;dumb&amp;quot; down off technology. That&#39;s why I started developing an interest to using an actual camera to take photos.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://moisentinel.github.io/attachments/sony-dsc-w830.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&#39;s the camera we bought in 2014 (not the one I mention in the first sentence; that was an old Kodak Kroma 35). And no, it doesn&#39;t take pictures as good as my phone, but the process of clicking pictures through it gives me pleasure. It&#39;s a romanticist feeling I cannot describe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One more example could be writing with a fountain pen. As far as my observation goes, it has become obsolete nowadays. Ball-point pens are disposable, cheaper (but not in the long term), easy-to-use. Thus, the mass opts for such pens.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But using a fountain-pen has this unique process, the inking, accidentally getting ink smeared in your hands, the writing, the feedback from the nib. All these contribute to a personification of an inanimate object. For me, writing with a fountain pen is a pleasure that any pen cannot replace.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maybe it&#39;s a temporary feeling (as my parents often say), I am not really sure! I feel as though I am trying to get involved with life and nature in a deeper way. But nevertheless, I am sure that I have to pause, live slowly with vigour. That&#39;s a rare thing to behold in this modern life.&lt;/p&gt;

        <content xml:lang="en" type="html">&lt;p&gt;মই এজন নিচাসক্ত যুৱক &lt;br /&gt;
পঢ়াৰ বাবে, শিকাৰ বাবে, &lt;br /&gt;
বুদ্ধিৰ ভোক পলোৱা হল মোৰ নিচা। &lt;br /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;মই এজন নিচাসক্ত ভাবুক &lt;br /&gt;

কত কি পাও, কোনে জানে? &lt;br /&gt;
সেই বাবে, মই নিচাসক্ত।&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;মই এজন নিচাসক্ত শিক্ষক &lt;br /&gt;
চক পেঞ্চিল নুচুলে মই ম্লান হয় পৰো। &lt;br /&gt;
শিকোৱা হল মোৰ নিচা। &lt;br /&gt;
উন্নতি এ মোৰ গুৰুদক্ষিনা, &lt;br /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This poem is very close to my heart. This poem is me. It is the confession of my addiction to learning, gaining knowledge, curiosity, thinking, teaching and writing. And I found that I could express it only in my native tongue Assamese.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I had never thought I would write something in Assamese, as I wasn&#39;t very &amp;quot;connected&amp;quot; with it. Recently, I started reading some Assamese literature and I was delighted. I understood the actual value. Maybe I will write about all this someday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway, this was my first endeavour in writing Assamese literature. Many more to go (I hope).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;a-literal-translation&quot; tabindex=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;a literal translation &lt;a class=&quot;header-anchor&quot; href=&quot;https://moisentinel.github.io/blog/p/i-am-an-addict/#a-literal-translation&quot;&gt;&lt;span aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot; class=&quot;header-anchor__symbol&quot;&gt;#&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There&#39;s no point in reading &amp;quot;translated poetry&amp;quot; since all the euphemisms and nuances are lost in the process. You&#39;re NOT supposed to. I just didn&#39;t want to keep (some of) you in the dark, at least you&#39;ll be able to get the gist. You can skip it of course:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am an addicted man,&lt;br /&gt;
To study, to learn&lt;br /&gt;
Satisfying intellect&#39;s hunger is my addiction.&lt;br /&gt;
Curiosity is my partner,&lt;br /&gt;
And I am, an addict.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am an addicted thinker,&lt;br /&gt;
Waking up at dawn to think is my addiction.&lt;br /&gt;
With tremendous desire to find and learn,&lt;br /&gt;
Who knows what I might find?&lt;br /&gt;
Thus, I am an addict.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am an addicted teacher,&lt;br /&gt;
I feel despair when unable to touch a chalk.&lt;br /&gt;
Teaching is my addiction.&lt;br /&gt;
Development is my &#39;Gurudakshina&#39; (tribute paid to a teacher),&lt;br /&gt;
To save humanity,&lt;br /&gt;
I am an addict.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am an addicted writer,&lt;br /&gt;
Paper-pencil are my narcotics,&lt;br /&gt;
The ink stains gives me solace.&lt;br /&gt;
My writings and revolution go parallelly,&lt;br /&gt;
That&#39;s how, I am an addict.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No, uhuh, nay!&lt;br /&gt;
I don&#39;t need skyscrapers,&lt;br /&gt;
I don&#39;t need money,&lt;br /&gt;
Just fulfill my wish to be addicted,&lt;br /&gt;
I only want to indulge in my addiction.&lt;br /&gt;
Because, I am an addict.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You&#39;re 15, 16, 17 or whatever years old, and you&#39;re walking that path you&#39;ve always walked, and suddenly you start discovering yourself. You start defining your individuality. The path which you used to always walk changes and you start walking the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/44272/the-road-not-taken&quot;&gt;untrodden, unharmed path&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then everything changes. Your timetable, your personality, you. You grow out of love with things and you meet new people. It&#39;s just the cycle of life. You start getting consumed by your work, by your passion and your interests. You start to learn more about the world. You start to understand the limitations and the advantages of living that life. You start to cuss at the system. You start to realize that things might be better if you did this or that. You start cussing at your past self for not having this epiphany earlier. You start reading, writing and fuelling your curiosity. And you become a workaholic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sometimes things fall apart. You get in conflicts with yourself. You cannot decide what you want. You cannot seem to understand why you&#39;re supposed to do X and Y and Z, why you&#39;re giving an exam that doesn&#39;t really matter, why you&#39;re fighting with your parents, why you&#39;re not talking to someone, or talking more with someone. You sometimes get upset, because you don&#39;t get to do the things you want.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You start exploring and you start devouring those uncharted territories. You start to like this life, this new life. You&#39;ve killed your past self and now you feel like a completely different person. You have shed your skin, you&#39;ve grown out of, you know, the shell or whatever. You have metamorphosised. You hate your past self, you cringe and you feel as though you have just woke up from a nightmare. That&#39;s the thing about discovering oneself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;2&quot; tabindex=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;2 &lt;a class=&quot;header-anchor&quot; href=&quot;https://moisentinel.github.io/blog/p/when-you-have-metamorphosised/#2&quot;&gt;&lt;span aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot; class=&quot;header-anchor__symbol&quot;&gt;#&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;screen-reader-only&quot;&gt;Direct link to this section&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maybe people are surprised and don&#39;t like this. And they think it&#39;s harming you because you&#39;re &amp;quot;wasting&amp;quot; too much time into exploring and that shit. Sometimes you doubt yourself and feel that you should not be doing this. But then again, the other part of you tells that you should, and that&#39;s important.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once you get past that stage, once you start becoming more aware of your actions and of the world, it becomes as though you&#39;re living a different life. As if you&#39;re seeing things through a third person perspective. You see things out of the ordinary, you&#39;re not blind anymore and now you can see colors. That&#39;s the thing about discovering yourself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You start reading about Stoicism, Marcus Aurelius, Epictetus and those who came before us. You pour yourself compulsively into what Dostoevsky said, what Kafka said, what Camus said and you study those great thinkers. You discover philosophy and morality. You try building your own ideology, your own set of ideals that you run by, sort of mental model. And then you go insane. A good kind of insane.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You start writing about your life and your ideals because you realise that this world needs change. It&#39;s dystopic, Kafkaesque and because YOU, can bring change. You seek people who share a similar mindset. You try to create a movement, against all odds. It&#39;s a pity you thought it would be easy. But do you stop? Hell no, you go on and you keep putting effort into the things that you really love. That&#39;s the thing about discovering yourself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;3&quot; tabindex=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;3 &lt;a class=&quot;header-anchor&quot; href=&quot;https://moisentinel.github.io/blog/p/when-you-have-metamorphosised/#3&quot;&gt;&lt;span aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot; class=&quot;header-anchor__symbol&quot;&gt;#&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;screen-reader-only&quot;&gt;Direct link to this section&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You meet more people. You become friends with some amazing people. People that are smart, likeable and helping. They are just like you, but better. And so you like them and you learn from them. You learn rationality and what it is like to transcend beyond the norm, you find serendipity and a sense of belonging, maybe be a bit too much.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And then a thought comes to your mind: &amp;quot;Not every relationship, every friendship works out.&amp;quot; You often get into disagreements with the person you were very fond of. You start to think if you were made for something else. You stay in that relationship because of &lt;a href=&quot;https://thedecisionlab.com/biases/the-sunk-cost-fallacy&quot;&gt;sunk-cost fallacy&lt;/a&gt;. But yet, you start spending less and less time with them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&#39;s a whole mess. You need that. There&#39;s chaos and yet there&#39;s order. There&#39;s entropy. It&#39;s absurd. You are absurd. We are absurd. The world is absurd. And discovering oneself is absurd.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You start getting addicted to a lot of things. You start getting addicted to thinking, to again fuelling your curiosity, to seeking out things that really matter, to discovering meaning. You start spending hundreds of hours trying to develop a new skill, you start delving more into the abstract feelings, the emotions, the language and the stuff that you had never even thought about. That&#39;s the thing about discovering yourself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You start receiving reproaches from your loved ones. Because they care. They care too much. Because they are your family, your friends, your people. They fear. They fear that you&#39;re not going to be okay, that you should focus on other things. They fear because it&#39;s new and absurd. But you disregard everything, the system, the society, the negativity. Out of spite, you create, learn, grow and escape. And eventually things get much better. That&#39;s the thing about discovering oneself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why? Why? It&#39;s a different, very different feeling. It&#39;s amazing. It&#39;s fucking amazing. I only wish I had discovered myself sooner. But I am really grateful that I did. You should try it sometime.&lt;/p&gt;

        <id>https://moisentinel.github.io/blog/p/god-is-evil/</id>
        <content xml:lang="en" type="html">&lt;p&gt;First of all, we don&#39;t know if God exists or not. I don&#39;t think there&#39;s a way to prove it. (Descarte&#39;s way of finding god was in my opinion, buffoonery). But let&#39;s say away we found a way to prove that it exists. What changes will it bring? Perhaps people will start to ponder upon another question: &amp;quot;&lt;em&gt;Whose&lt;/em&gt; god is this?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What if it isn&#39;t what we thought all along? What if it isn&#39;t a supernatural, omnipotent, omnipresent, omniscient being? What if God is not &amp;quot;God&amp;quot;?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And what about the possibility that God is &lt;strong&gt;Evil&lt;/strong&gt;? We haven&#39;t considered that yet, have we?&lt;br /&gt;
I read about it for the first time in &lt;a href=&quot;https://existentialcomics.com/comic/535&quot;&gt;existentialcomics.com&lt;/a&gt;, and then I discussed the topic with my friends.&lt;br /&gt;
That question intrigues me. What if, really, God is Evil?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That would change everything, or maybe not. There are a few plausible outcomes: people will then stop believing in God, or blame others: &amp;quot;It&#39;s YOUR God&amp;quot; unlike if God was good: &amp;quot;It&#39;s OUR God&amp;quot;. Or something completely different altogether. Perhaps it will change their standards. &amp;quot;Evil&amp;quot; will become the new &amp;quot;good&amp;quot;, as jain put it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It will turn out as a nightmare and existential crisis, if the God, which is evil, really made us. If it did, then did it make us all evil, a part of itself? Is this why violence comes naturally to us?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is all a big IF though, since &lt;strong&gt;we don&#39;t really know&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, let us suppose we don&#39;t know if it exists (which we really don&#39;t; i.e, reality), does it really matter if it is evil, or good, or dumb? Maybe to me it doesn&#39;t, and to some rationalists, atheists, agnostics, EAs, etc. either.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But, the majority yet suffers. A banal attempt to put &amp;quot;God&amp;quot; in place of &amp;quot;good&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;truth&amp;quot;. They can&#39;t quite &amp;quot;un-believe&amp;quot; yet. It&#39;s their faith, their only solace, how could they deny?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The word &amp;quot;God&amp;quot; is created by man, interpretations are made by man, and confusions are caused by man. Well, bunch of rational creatures, aren&#39;t we?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&#39;s something entirely different. We&#39;re just substituting. In my opinion, we&#39;re not capable enough to truly understand the gist. There&#39;s no way to conclude anything.&lt;/p&gt;

          my base-rate neglect

        <content xml:lang="en" type="html">&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Long gone are the times when you see people learn for the sake of learning, and long gone are the times when you see people curious, and use that curiosity to solve the unsolvable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This statement was based on my own observations. I hadn&#39;t consulted any statistics. Perhaps it was a base-rate neglect from my end, plus it was very small-scale. After a discussion with vhaangogh and untrivial, I realised that this &amp;quot;claim&amp;quot; might not be much true.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;untrivial contradicted my statement by saying that the era might not be gone, that learning for the sake of learning has become in fact &lt;strong&gt;more&lt;/strong&gt; common, justifying it by:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;More resources &amp;amp; education &amp;amp; social benefits per person increases base rate of curiosity/solving and that these effects dominate any negative externalities caused by development.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I countered the argument by saying that people usually take things for granted; resources are endowed upon us much easier then before, which reduces their value. And that &lt;a href=&quot;https://moisentinel.github.io/blog/p/the-idiosyncratic-era/#:~:text=achieve%20just%20that.-,consumer%20culture,-%2C%20in%20this%20way&quot;&gt;consumer culture&lt;/a&gt; (tiktok, instagram, etc.) kills our curiosity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There was no way to be sure if the no. of people learning for the sake of learning had a change or not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The answer to generalists vs specialists was also highly personal, because of different learning styles of people. Is there any way to tell which of them is better? Perhaps not from the &amp;quot;opportunity&amp;quot; standpoint (i.e, jobs), but for the amount of value it brings to the learnings?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Uncertainty loomed clear.&lt;/p&gt;

          a realisation: transcending beyond the concept of scoring
        </summary>
        <updated>2024-02-04T00:00:00Z</updated>
        <id>https://moisentinel.github.io/blog/p/why-do-i-study/</id>
        <content xml:lang="en" type="html">&lt;h2 id=&quot;motive&quot; tabindex=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;motive &lt;a class=&quot;header-anchor&quot; href=&quot;https://moisentinel.github.io/blog/p/why-do-i-study/#motive&quot;&gt;&lt;span aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot; class=&quot;header-anchor__symbol&quot;&gt;#&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;screen-reader-only&quot;&gt;Direct link to this section&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;What is my motive to study?&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&#39;No, it is not to score, but to learn.&#39;&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;Then why do I have &lt;a href=&quot;https://moisentinel.github.io/blog/p/an-intellectual-dillemma/&quot;&gt;inner conflicts&lt;/a&gt; when studying?&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&#39;I love studying. The issue is with &amp;quot;why&amp;quot; I am &lt;em&gt;supposed&lt;/em&gt; to study. The most causal explanation I can give is that I put too much weightage on my principles &lt;em&gt;against&lt;/em&gt; the &amp;quot;study to score&amp;quot; idea, which seeps into my mind when I am practicing and studying.&#39;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;remembrance&quot; tabindex=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;remembrance &lt;a class=&quot;header-anchor&quot; href=&quot;https://moisentinel.github.io/blog/p/why-do-i-study/#remembrance&quot;&gt;&lt;span aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot; class=&quot;header-anchor__symbol&quot;&gt;#&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;screen-reader-only&quot;&gt;Direct link to this section&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I would like to frame things differently to myself now. Instead of solving question papers for the best possible marks (which is inherently the objective behind mock tests and such), I will solve them to check my understanding and refine my knowledge (this aligns with my core values, which is to learn and acquire more knowledge.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It won&#39;t matter if I score low. I would win &lt;strong&gt;inevitably&lt;/strong&gt; if I learnt something new. And I believe that it &lt;em&gt;may&lt;/em&gt; make me score more (I mean, if you are crystal clear with your concepts, how can you not score?).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the main motive is to keep in mind that &lt;strong&gt;I am not doing it for the marks.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&quot;intentions&quot; tabindex=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;intentions &lt;a class=&quot;header-anchor&quot; href=&quot;https://moisentinel.github.io/blog/p/why-do-i-study/#intentions&quot;&gt;&lt;span aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot; class=&quot;header-anchor__symbol&quot;&gt;#&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;screen-reader-only&quot;&gt;Direct link to this section&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whenever I will watch a video on a concept or revise a topic, I would make myself remember my intentions of doing so. And they are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I love learning, and I will learn for the sake of learning (intrinsic motivation).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It will help me understand the world.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I can use it to contribute to the world.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;wb-college%3F&quot; tabindex=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;wb college? &lt;a class=&quot;header-anchor&quot; href=&quot;https://moisentinel.github.io/blog/p/why-do-i-study/#wb-college%3F&quot;&gt;&lt;span aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot; class=&quot;header-anchor__symbol&quot;&gt;#&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;screen-reader-only&quot;&gt;Direct link to this section&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many students, including me, get startled when they think about college. &amp;quot;Oh no, I have got to do X and Y to get into a good college!&amp;quot;.&lt;br /&gt;
I believe this is some sort of FOMO, but everything will be alright eventually. If you have your reasons clear, you are going to accomplish your job.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My parents worry about this too, because I am too &amp;quot;away&amp;quot; from the mainstream. This does not align with their ideology; well, they were raised in a different era and a different way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;realisation&quot; tabindex=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;realisation &lt;a class=&quot;header-anchor&quot; href=&quot;https://moisentinel.github.io/blog/p/why-do-i-study/#realisation&quot;&gt;&lt;span aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot; class=&quot;header-anchor__symbol&quot;&gt;#&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;screen-reader-only&quot;&gt;Direct link to this section&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I do realise that I had been in a slump. I had lost my curiosity, because I forgot my reasons why I study. Maybe this is high time that you too realise why YOU study.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Studying and learning should be fun, not mundane and aimless, which is why you need to understand what tickles your inner (studious) Laughing Buddha to wake up.&lt;/p&gt;

          on polymathy, autodidactism and purpose
        </summary>
        <updated>2024-01-28T00:00:00Z</updated>
        <id>https://moisentinel.github.io/blog/p/another-renaissance/</id>
        <content xml:lang="en" type="html">&lt;p&gt;Long gone are the times when you see people learn for the sake of learning, and long gone are the times when you see people curious, and use that curiosity to solve the unsolvable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What if you could pursue a wide range of disciplines while educating yourself on the way, and feel a sense of autonomy on your hands? I feel that the world would’ve been a better place if many of us pondered upon this question. But what stopped us to do so? There can be many reasons, including capitalism, technology (how ironic), etc. I will leave you to think about it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But let us remind ourselves of the Renaissance. Many thinkers adopted themselves to learn several of the disciplines, most notably Leonardo da Vinci, which now is remembered as one of the most important innovators, painters, engineers, scientists, sculptors, and architects and so much more. We’ll discuss just that in this post.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;generalists-vs-specialists&quot; tabindex=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;generalists vs specialists &lt;a class=&quot;header-anchor&quot; href=&quot;https://moisentinel.github.io/blog/p/another-renaissance/#generalists-vs-specialists&quot;&gt;&lt;span aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot; class=&quot;header-anchor__symbol&quot;&gt;#&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;screen-reader-only&quot;&gt;Direct link to this section&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are two types of people, &lt;strong&gt;generalists and specialists&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;
The &lt;strong&gt;specialists&lt;/strong&gt; are able to do work only in a specific discipline, but they &lt;em&gt;master&lt;/em&gt; at it. And on the other end of the spectrum are the &lt;strong&gt;generalists&lt;/strong&gt;, which have a wide skill set and a variety of knowledge and in turn, are able to use it to interlink multiple disciplines and solve problems which are new and difficult.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am deliberately making the generalists seem &lt;em&gt;superior&lt;/em&gt; in the above description. Specialists, without doubt, can do wonders at the field they are in, can only do so much for problems that require an enormous amount of inspiration, understanding and observation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;polymathy&quot; tabindex=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;polymathy &lt;a class=&quot;header-anchor&quot; href=&quot;https://moisentinel.github.io/blog/p/another-renaissance/#polymathy&quot;&gt;&lt;span aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot; class=&quot;header-anchor__symbol&quot;&gt;#&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;screen-reader-only&quot;&gt;Direct link to this section&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Generalists, also known as polymaths, Renaissance Man or &lt;em&gt;Homo Universalis&lt;/em&gt;, embrace the natural state of human life, that is, to explore and be curious [1]. And they have tapped into that very stubborn and childish curiosity which successfully keeps them wide awake at night.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe5c5b254-a70e-495b-8560-3a4c7e02610d_2048x2048.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;modern Renaissance man as depicted by Firefly&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most notable polymaths include Benjamin Franklin (one of the founding father of the USA), Leonardo da Vinci, René Descartes (father of modern philosophy), Isaac Newton, Rabindranath Tagore and so on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Elle Griffin writes about the need of bringing back the Renaissance man concisely in her &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.elysian.press/p/bring-back-the-renaissance-man?utm_source=share&amp;amp;utm_medium=android&amp;amp;r=2wqx7m&quot;&gt;post&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You need two things, curiosity and dedication: the eagerness to question, and the patience to learn.&lt;br /&gt;
These are the things that make a polymath. They do not simply have broad interests and knowledge, but also have significant expertise in several of the fields, too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To be a Renaissance man, you have to be exploring and self-aware. You have to develop skills and educate yourself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For me, it gives a sense of autonomy, and the ability to do whatever I want. And because I am fairly confident that I can put it into good use, I don’t ever want to become a specialist and confine myself to a monotonous lifestyle.&lt;br /&gt;
If you choose polymathy, you are not bound to maths, sciences, physics, etc. You can explore, you can &lt;em&gt;choose&lt;/em&gt; to do whatever excites you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Polymathy grants you freedom and a chance to cultivate your curiosity and make something fruitful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;autodidactism&quot; tabindex=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;autodidactism &lt;a class=&quot;header-anchor&quot; href=&quot;https://moisentinel.github.io/blog/p/another-renaissance/#autodidactism&quot;&gt;&lt;span aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot; class=&quot;header-anchor__symbol&quot;&gt;#&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;screen-reader-only&quot;&gt;Direct link to this section&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Autodidactism (or Self-Educating) runs hand-in-hand with polymathy. You learn more intuitively when you teach yourself. And it becomes even more effective when you teach somebody else [2].&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have been teaching myself a thing or two for as long as I can remember. I taught myself coding, playing keyboard, a bit of music theory, guitar, some philosophy, etc. and I never went to any tuition or coaching for my studies. And so far I am &lt;a href=&quot;https://visionoflife.substack.com/i/140030345/learning-effective-study-techniques&quot;&gt;doing great&lt;/a&gt;. The coding skills that I learned about 4 years ago, still come handy to this day.&lt;br /&gt;
As of now, I am trying to teach myself some precalculus now, with the help of &lt;em&gt;Intermediate Algebra&lt;/em&gt; by Miller, O’Neill and Hyde [3].&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I try to teach myself a new skill, I am &lt;em&gt;choosing&lt;/em&gt; to do so, without any external force. It is my purely intrinsic motivation and curiosity, which drives me to understand things on a deeper level. You learn &lt;em&gt;only&lt;/em&gt; for the sake of learning, and not for any other reason.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;my-concern&quot; tabindex=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;my concern &lt;a class=&quot;header-anchor&quot; href=&quot;https://moisentinel.github.io/blog/p/another-renaissance/#my-concern&quot;&gt;&lt;span aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot; class=&quot;header-anchor__symbol&quot;&gt;#&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The craze for autodidactism and polymathy has reduced, and so has peoples’ ability to think [4], and I am concerned about it.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ffaa81a97-accf-424a-a2e3-615de1e35020_739x186.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The conventional education systems are a testament to &lt;a href=&quot;https://builtin.com/data-science/goodharts-law&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Goodhart’s Law&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt;.&lt;/strong&gt; Where students are taught to score good rather than teaching how to be a good human and live life well. We are deliberately prevented from cultivating our curiosity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We need to make people aware of this. Saaim, Vihaan Sondhi and few of my friends want to start a literary movement (another Renaissance?) on this issue. It might be a long shot, but we are not going to stop.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We need an intellectual reform, because even though people are &lt;em&gt;educated&lt;/em&gt; in the modern era, they fail to be &lt;em&gt;wise&lt;/em&gt;. There is a stark difference between the two.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&quot;glorious-purpose&quot; tabindex=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;glorious purpose &lt;a class=&quot;header-anchor&quot; href=&quot;https://moisentinel.github.io/blog/p/another-renaissance/#glorious-purpose&quot;&gt;&lt;span aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot; class=&quot;header-anchor__symbol&quot;&gt;#&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We are humans, and we are born explorers. We are obliged to pay homage to what we were made for and what our purpose is in this life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Our purpose goes beyond personal fulfilment; it involves contributing to the well-being of many.”&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How do I relate polymathy and autodidactism to contributing to the collective soul?&lt;br /&gt;
In my opinion, we can use the knowledge gained by educating ourselves on a myriad of fields to &lt;strong&gt;create&lt;/strong&gt;. This creation can be as minor as this post written by me, or maybe even a cure to an untreatable disease. It needs not be an act of &lt;a href=&quot;https://vihaansondhi.substack.com/p/on-effective-altruism?utm_source=post-email-title&amp;amp;publication_id=2235493&amp;amp;post_id=140879966&amp;amp;utm_campaign=email-post-title&amp;amp;isFreemail=true&amp;amp;r=2wqx7m&amp;amp;utm_medium=email&quot;&gt;EA&lt;/a&gt;, but anything that contributes to a greater good.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is up to us now, to bring mankind back to its glory.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;People are so much less ambitious, they don&#39;t want to become someone who contributes to something good, or live a better life. They toil and toil, yet they are unable to succeed. Why? There is a lack of self-awareness, a lack of understanding the world and lack of exposure.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;System is too conserved. People cannot be either too good or too bad. In special reference to Indian society, the &amp;quot;system&amp;quot; is where the good are punished for being good. They are banished from the system and the hope for change is once again lost [Anand Mishra, IPS].&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Life&#39;s purpose is to contribute to the collective soul. That mean&#39;s helping the community, either by creating something, doing something or anything else. Once you do it, people will remember you. And your glorious purpose is fulfilled. In short, change the world.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There can be two types of people: the creators and the destructors. The creators contribute to the society, make amazing discoveries, help people. The destructors do the opposite. They hate, they destroy, they slow down growth.&lt;br /&gt;
But the question is, can either of them survive without the other?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You are like a cantilever. You can only go one direction, and that&#39;s towards improvement (one of my teachers used to say that &amp;quot;I can only go up, not down.&amp;quot;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Only the people who are crazy enough to proclaim that they can change the world are the only ones that do so (Steve Jobs)&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Exams are near (within a week) and here I am, completely burnt out of the want to do conventional study- by this, I mean studying for exams and entrance tests and all that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some part of me tells that I should be more disciplined and focus on one task for now. A larger part of me fells me to go explore because it thinks that this scenario is limiting me from unlocking my potential. That larger part of me is curious, exploring and dedicated. After all, this is the natural state of humans [1].&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My calendars don&#39;t work anymore. I often find myself doing something else: reading, editing, writing, organising my obsidian, instead of giving tests and revising. Don&#39;t get me wrong, I love studying, I love it. but I am against the system of studying FOR exams. Call me idealistic, I don&#39;t care, because this is an outrage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;what%E2%80%99s-wrong%3F&quot; tabindex=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;what’s wrong? &lt;a class=&quot;header-anchor&quot; href=&quot;https://moisentinel.github.io/blog/p/an-intellectual-dillemma/#what%E2%80%99s-wrong%3F&quot;&gt;&lt;span aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot; class=&quot;header-anchor__symbol&quot;&gt;#&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;screen-reader-only&quot;&gt;Direct link to this section&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Math appeals to me, so do writing, reading, creating my own website, publishing things, building a knowledge workflow, organising my system, planning, polymathy, philosophy, physics and imagination.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I often blame the education system for putting us into this place. We are deliberately dumbed down to confine into a conventional path, guided by the conservative society. Curiosity has been killed, imagination has been prevented.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JEE? NEET? No, I call it rat race. There&#39;s anger in me. And I can&#39;t seem to pour it out anywhere but in writing. I am thinking about my future, where I want to create something good, not &amp;quot;enjoy&amp;quot; with a nice &amp;quot;package&amp;quot;- with &lt;strong&gt;special&lt;/strong&gt; reference to the Indian culture of education (and money grabbing)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We were not meant to enjoy, we were made to suffer. And in suffering, we find peace. We were made to contribute to the collective soul and do good. Yet, we stray farther and farther away from that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I see people suffering from depression while preparing for JEE and NEET. In turn, they fail to prosper even after staying away from home to study for 1 year. They also &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/CBSE/comments/13bwox5/fck_jee_i_am_going_abroad_suggest_some_colleges/&quot;&gt;consider&lt;/a&gt; going abroad. There they find the recurring crappy obstacle: money. They can&#39;t afford.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This bone-crushing competition and mindset of grinding FOR exams has crippled us, intellectually, mentally and socially.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;what-can-you-do-then%3F-what-choice-do-you-have%3F-this-is-not-a-wealthy-country.&quot; tabindex=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;What can you do then? What choice do you have? This is not a wealthy country. &lt;a class=&quot;header-anchor&quot; href=&quot;https://moisentinel.github.io/blog/p/an-intellectual-dillemma/#what-can-you-do-then%3F-what-choice-do-you-have%3F-this-is-not-a-wealthy-country.&quot;&gt;&lt;span aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot; class=&quot;header-anchor__symbol&quot;&gt;#&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Educate yourself, learn yourself and teach others, not to crack exams, but to solve the unsolvable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Leonardo Da Vinci, Blaise Pascal, Einstein, Feynman, Edison, Tesla and hell our own Ramanujan were autodidacts. Not to mention countless others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Autodidactism has lost its popularity, and so has the peoples&#39; ability to think. I fear for the next generation if this trend continues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://d30uef581frdjs.cloudfront.net/657acfbd5ef98b00142e2293/89EtmD4kvM2HzpvEC5peAV-image.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://qr.ae/pKlyQI&quot;&gt;Source&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many of my peers often discuss starting a new Renaissance, and while it is pretty &lt;em&gt;idealistic&lt;/em&gt;, we are in dire need. We need some sort of intellectual reform. People are educated in the modern era, for sure. But they fail to become wise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;peace%3F&quot; tabindex=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;Peace? &lt;a class=&quot;header-anchor&quot; href=&quot;https://moisentinel.github.io/blog/p/an-intellectual-dillemma/#peace%3F&quot;&gt;&lt;span aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot; class=&quot;header-anchor__symbol&quot;&gt;#&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;screen-reader-only&quot;&gt;Direct link to this section&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This doesn&#39;t end here. I have not yet found peace. But through suffering, I will. I love my struggles, that&#39;s all. But I will not struggle for a worthless, trivial goal: the goal to prep for exams and getting a good career. I have my glorious purpose: to become a good human, and change the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And I will fulfil it, anyhow.&lt;/p&gt;

        <content xml:lang="en" type="html">&lt;p&gt;This is my translation of a few Sanskrit shlokas from the book Shemushi (NCERT Class 10).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;आलस्यं हि मनुष्याणां शरीरस्थो महान् रिपुः।&lt;br /&gt;
नास्त्युद्यमसमो बन्धुः कृत्वा यं नावसीदति ॥1॥&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Translation:&lt;/strong&gt; Laziness is man&#39;s ultimate enemy and struggle is man&#39;s true friend.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;गुणी गुणं वेत्ति न वेत्ति निर्गुणो,&lt;br /&gt;
बली बलं वेत्ति न वेत्ति निर्बलः।&lt;br /&gt;
पिको वसन्तस्य गुणं न वायसः,&lt;br /&gt;
करी च सिंहस्य बलं न मूषकः ॥2॥&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Translation:&lt;/strong&gt;  Only the wise can appreciate wisdom, not the unwise;&lt;br /&gt;
Only the strong can appreciate strength, not the weak;&lt;br /&gt;
Like how crows can&#39;t appreciate autumn as cuckoos do and how mice can&#39;t appreciate the strength of lions as elephants do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;निमित्तमुद्दिश्य हि यः प्रकुप्यति,&lt;br /&gt;
ध्रुवं स तस्यापगमे प्रसीदति।&lt;br /&gt;
अकारणद्वेषि मनस्तु यस्य वै,&lt;br /&gt;
कथं जनस्तं परितोषयिष्यति ॥3॥&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Translation:&lt;/strong&gt;  Who gets agitated with a purpose finds happiness in the end;&lt;br /&gt;
How will the person who gets angry without a reason find satisfaction?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;उदीरितोऽर्थः पशुनापि गृह्यते,&lt;br /&gt;
हयाश्च नागाश्च वहन्ति बोधिताः।&lt;br /&gt;
अनुक्तमप्यूहति पण्डितो जनः,&lt;br /&gt;
परेगितज्ञानफला हि बुद्धयः ॥4॥&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Translation:&lt;/strong&gt; Even horses and elephants can understand what is told and instructed, only those who understand the untold [hints or metaphors] are truly wise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;क्रोधो हि शत्रुः प्रथमो नराणां,&lt;br /&gt;
देहस्थितो देहविनाशनाय।&lt;br /&gt;
यथास्थितः काष्ठगतो हि वह्निः,&lt;br /&gt;
स एव वह्निर्दहते शरीरम् ॥5॥&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Translation:&lt;/strong&gt; The destroyer of man is the anger inside us. Like the timber burns itself from the fire that it causes, the anger in us turns us into ashes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;मृगाः मृगैः सङ्गमनुव्रजन्ति,&lt;br /&gt;
गावश्च गोभिः तुरगास्तुरङ्गैः।&lt;br /&gt;
मूर्खाश्च मूखैः सुधियः सुधीभिः,&lt;br /&gt;
समान-शील-व्यसनेषु सख्यम् ।।6।।&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Translation:&lt;/strong&gt; Deers make friends with other deers,&lt;br /&gt;
Cows with other cows,&lt;br /&gt;
Horses with other horses,&lt;br /&gt;
Fools with other fools,&lt;br /&gt;
Wise with the wise.&lt;br /&gt;
Similar people attract.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;सेवितव्यो महावृक्षः फलच्छायासमन्वितः।&lt;br /&gt;
यदि दैवात् फलं नास्ति छाया केन निवार्यते ॥7॥&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Translation:&lt;/strong&gt; One should seek shelter in a shade providing, fruit giving tree. But, if by any chance, there is no fruit, no one can prevent you from getting the shade.&lt;br /&gt;
अमन्त्रमक्षरं नास्ति, नास्ति मूलमनौषधम्।&lt;br /&gt;
अयोग्यः पुरुषः नास्ति योजकस्तत्र दुर्लभः ॥8॥&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Translation:&lt;/strong&gt; No mantra is devoid of letters,&lt;br /&gt;
No medicine is devoid of herbs,&lt;br /&gt;
No man is unworthy,&lt;br /&gt;
Finding these particular combinations are rare.&lt;br /&gt;
संपत्तौ च विपत्तौ च महतामेकरूपता।&lt;br /&gt;
उदये सविता रक्तो रक्तोश्चास्तमये तथा ॥9॥&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Translation:&lt;/strong&gt; Noble person acts the same at both the times of despair and bliss.&lt;br /&gt;
Like, the sun remains red both at the times of rising and setting. [Similar to Stoicism]&lt;br /&gt;
विचित्रे खलु संसारे नास्ति किञ्चिन्निरर्थकम्।&lt;br /&gt;
अश्वश्चेद् धावने वीरः भारस्य वहने खरः ॥10॥&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Translation:&lt;/strong&gt; In this strange universe, nothing is meaningless.&lt;br /&gt;
If the horse is useful for running, the donkey&#39;s niche is to bear weight.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I had been preparing for it since the night before. Bags, check. Clothes, check. Notebook and a pen, check. Enough audiobooks and podcasts, check.&lt;br /&gt;
I wake up early, and start getting ready. And off we go, packed up with 12 other people in a mini-bus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This particular time of the year is called the Picnic Season. People can be seen overflowing in all the beautiful places: lakes, rivers, waterfalls. And I was going to be a part of it.&lt;br /&gt;
What happens here is that, multiple families (friends, acquaintances, etc.) make an arrangement to go to some place together. Now, I am not a person who likes to spend time in scenic places with people I don’t &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; know. But this time, I had to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I stay silent for most of the journey. I am listening to Feynman’s Fun to Imagine interview&lt;sup class=&quot;footnote-ref&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;footnote-link&quot; href=&quot;https://moisentinel.github.io/blog/p/what-is-it-like-to-be-present-and-observe/#fn1&quot; id=&quot;fnref1&quot;&gt;[1]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. I am observing the journey with curiosity. I am in a dormant state.&lt;br /&gt;
We are almost there. It is a hilly area, the roadside looks unknown, isolated and lacking people. Something out of an apocalyptic video game.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The picnic spot is a riverbank full of people with loudspeakers all around; a stark difference. On the other side, there is a hill which is full of trees. We settle down in a secluded place. The water is greyish. I see people over there, dancing, playing, cooking. They have littered too much.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There was enough time for lunch, so my mother and I go to a beautiful part of the picnic spot. If I was to describe it in one word, it would be “serene”. I sit down on this boulder, and feel the current of the river in my hands.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8bf82847-13f2-4108-95ed-301bf3c4431a_756x1008.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;300&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Being away from phones, and just being present to the nature; that is peace. Maybe, I think, I can write about this (even though I am not a poet):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Here I sit on a stone,&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Flow of the river,&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Crashing aloud&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;And white foam in between&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Stagnant boulders;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Adrift ashore,&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;With the person I adore,&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Without a cloud in the sky&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Yet I feel the bliss&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;And what I was looking for;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Near the smooth cold water, I write&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;A warm hope flows by.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We continue roaming around. I feel more alive and happy. This place has brought out something in me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I see a group of drunkards dancing. My first instinct was to go and dance &lt;em&gt;with&lt;/em&gt; them. But buried by my shyness, I didn’t. I think now, why do we care too much? Why do we think about consequences? What decides at what times you should be cautious or reckless?&lt;br /&gt;
We find the drunkards again. They are happy, carefree and hedonistic. This time, I go and dance. This feels awkward, but this is beyond the norm of what you should do, and what you shouldn’t.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Soon enough, we reach our group. I talk with an &lt;em&gt;uncle&lt;/em&gt;, and he gives me some advice. “Be progressive”, he said. “Be yourself”, he said. And I couldn’t quite disagree. He turned out to be a college lecturer in the sciences field, but he had spent enough time with law, arts and commerce alike. Kind of a polymath. Quite relatable, I said to myself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There’s so many people, yet I seem to find the most pleasure in solitude. I go to a corner and sit down. I recall how one of my friends wanted to be an omnipresent observer&lt;sup class=&quot;footnote-ref&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;footnote-link&quot; href=&quot;https://moisentinel.github.io/blog/p/what-is-it-like-to-be-present-and-observe/#fn2&quot; id=&quot;fnref2&quot;&gt;[2]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. I feel that way now. I want to learn what makes them tick, what drives them, and how do they go on about their lives. Is it necessity? Is it a ritual or a tradition? Why are they here? Seeing, I believe, is an art form in its own way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ffcd93cb9-fd10-4cdf-8334-889db6af14d6_756x1008.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;300&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I write. I feel that we are a speck of dust compared to this world and beyond. Yet, we take pride in our trivial problems. What a waste. We disgrace the collective soul by being too self-indulgent. I knew, while writing, that I maybe hypocritical. That made me frown.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A stranger sat down by me. Well, &lt;em&gt;almost&lt;/em&gt; a stranger. He is our driver.&lt;br /&gt;
He struck up quite a conversation, and I realised that you learn more by talking to a stranger than by talking to someone you know quite well.&lt;br /&gt;
He talks about waterfalls, about his previous journeys, nature and rivers. I think, man, he knows his stuff. Turns out, he studied geography. He is also an artist, but he left doing art a while ago, because he realised that people don’t appreciate art enough; they think that it is &lt;em&gt;easy&lt;/em&gt;. But I tell him that art is wonderful, obscure and grand. He agrees.&lt;br /&gt;
Unfamiliarity turned into likeability, just like Byung-Chul Han says in The Agony of Eros.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F226955f6-1db2-4fb5-bc7e-87d4da2a0d6d_812x1081.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;300&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Soon thereafter, we had lunch, and it was time to go.&lt;br /&gt;
The whole group clicks a photo together, and I see myself smiling. I am quite happy on how it all turned out. I was skeptic of this notion of “picnic culture”, but this instant made me see the beauty of this world.&lt;br /&gt;
Others may have different definitions for picnics. But mine is that it gives you an opportunity to be present, observe and let the contentment flow into you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s almost night. I am feeling tired, so I sleep for a while. I am listening to The Truth&lt;sup class=&quot;footnote-ref&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;footnote-link&quot; href=&quot;https://moisentinel.github.io/blog/p/what-is-it-like-to-be-present-and-observe/#fn3&quot; id=&quot;fnref3&quot;&gt;[3]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; and a few chapters of an audiobook. Everybody’s tired, only a few are talking. I glance outside the window, into the sky. There, I see the Orion constellation. For the first time in my life, I have &lt;em&gt;noticed&lt;/em&gt; a constellation. And I feel quite proud, as a profound feeling of happiness fills me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On this day, I understood that, maybe, we ought to be more observant.&lt;br /&gt;
But this makes me think, what’s next?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This travelogue depicts the events of 30th Dec, 2023. It was a trip to the Mawkrang Picnic Spot. It is “outside” the themes that I usually write on. But I wanted to try writing a narrative and see where that takes me. I thought, “well, why not?”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

          a short(est) fiction story.

        <content xml:lang="en" type="html">&lt;p&gt;I found them grovelling, shovelling, up in the snow. It was a narrow road on a hill, and beyond the edge was oblivion. They said, &amp;quot;There ain&#39;t no point in grimacing, we do this everyday.&amp;quot; There, on a cold morning, I found them whimpering.&lt;br /&gt;
Up until that point, I had been driving for 3 1/2 hours towards north. On the road, I saw lumberjacks cutting wood from certain trees out of many. I saw snowbound possums and rodents waiting to be killed by predators. I saw  beyond what was present, not a blue sky and whiteness spread across.&lt;br /&gt;
I saw red, and black. I saw misanthropy, and I calculated. I had lust for it, I wanted it so bad. Differences of opinion, between my other ego, clashed just in front of them.&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;Whadaya want?&amp;quot;. I wanted to free them of their remorse, because I knew how bad it feels, to be stuck, like Sisyphus. He wasn&#39;t happy.&lt;br /&gt;
As they ran, I ran along, like the possum and the hyena I saw, screaming and howling. When the hyena caught up to the possum, there was never a better time. Only one could win.&lt;br /&gt;
Splatter, grind. Silence. There was no whimpering. Both the possums lay there wasted. Death never left.&lt;br /&gt;
I went upto my car, and I thought why I had done it. But there was only silence, even my other ego stopped talking.&lt;br /&gt;
Had I not find bliss? Was I condemned to drive, forever?&lt;/p&gt;

        <content xml:lang="en" type="html">&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Curb your desire. Don’t set out your heart to so many things and you will get what you need.”&lt;br /&gt;
-&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Epictetus&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As Epictetus suggests, you shouldn’t try to participate in a number of desirable activities at one time, and then one shall be able to achieve the things that one needs. &lt;strong&gt;Less is more.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;desire-leads-to-retribution&quot; tabindex=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;desire leads to retribution &lt;a class=&quot;header-anchor&quot; href=&quot;https://moisentinel.github.io/blog/p/curb-your-desires/#desire-leads-to-retribution&quot;&gt;&lt;span aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot; class=&quot;header-anchor__symbol&quot;&gt;#&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;screen-reader-only&quot;&gt;Direct link to this section&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Until a few weeks ago, I was overly optimistic, ambitious and really idealistic (perhaps it can be seen in my &lt;a href=&quot;https://open.substack.com/pub/visionoflife/p/were-not-studying-for-fun?r=2wqx7m&amp;amp;utm_campaign=post&amp;amp;utm_medium=web&quot;&gt;post&lt;/a&gt;). I wanted to do many things: study multiple subjects which are outside my league and my current coursework, engage in multiple projects and hobbies, I wanted to be “knowledgeable”, and inspired by people across the world, I wanted to be &lt;em&gt;extraordinary&lt;/em&gt; (or as my mentor said, an octopus).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I wanted to grasp everything and anything, and for that I sacrificed one very important thing, and that is &lt;strong&gt;mastery&lt;/strong&gt;. Sure, my so-called field was expanding, but it lacked the much-needed depth. And surely I could talk about many things, and I believed I found my niche. But when I was asked about the very insides of a particular topic, I couldn’t answer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That’s when I realised, &lt;strong&gt;too much is too much.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;mastery-%3E-completion&quot; tabindex=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;mastery &amp;gt; completion &lt;a class=&quot;header-anchor&quot; href=&quot;https://moisentinel.github.io/blog/p/curb-your-desires/#mastery-%3E-completion&quot;&gt;&lt;span aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot; class=&quot;header-anchor__symbol&quot;&gt;#&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;screen-reader-only&quot;&gt;Direct link to this section&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But we, humans, tend to overload ourselves. But we must remember to focus on what is needed. We must value our time, which is already so very little, and make the best out of it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gaining mastery is tedious. It takes &lt;em&gt;perseverance&lt;/em&gt;. It takes time (~&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4662388/&quot;&gt;10000 hours&lt;/a&gt;). And thus, naturally, we don’t like to do tedious work. But it is all worth it; with the mastery of a particular skill or subject, imagine how much you could contribute to this world. You could actually do something worthwhile.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Why should we wander around pointlessly, dividing our precious time to things that don’t matter at the moment?&lt;/em&gt; Every event, every possibility, is scheduled, and are not in our hands. One thing at a time, it is possible to become “knowledgeable” as well as again mastery.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;acceptance&quot; tabindex=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;acceptance &lt;a class=&quot;header-anchor&quot; href=&quot;https://moisentinel.github.io/blog/p/curb-your-desires/#acceptance&quot;&gt;&lt;span aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot; class=&quot;header-anchor__symbol&quot;&gt;#&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;screen-reader-only&quot;&gt;Direct link to this section&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We fight. We humans are optimistic (well, most of us). It is both a curse and a boon. But in a few scenarios, such like this, we do not have a choice but to surrender to the truth, the odds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nietzsche writes in his book &lt;em&gt;Ecce Homo&lt;/em&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My formula for greatness in a human being is &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;amor fati&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;: that one wants nothing to be different, not forward, not backward, not in all eternity. Not merely bear what is necessary, still less conceal it—all idealism is mendacity in the face of what is necessary—but &lt;em&gt;love&lt;/em&gt; it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We must love our fate, and what it has in it for us. And we must be pragmatic about our decisions and our goals and plans. One step at a time, progress will be made. I think in my case, I have grown since that point of time. Consider this post more as my personal reflection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;To think about it, even nature is not perfect, so why should we be?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

          know thyself.

        <id>https://moisentinel.github.io/blog/p/on-discovery/</id>
        <content xml:lang="en" type="html">&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-art&quot; tabindex=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;the art &lt;a class=&quot;header-anchor&quot; href=&quot;https://moisentinel.github.io/blog/p/on-discovery/#the-art&quot;&gt;&lt;span aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot; class=&quot;header-anchor__symbol&quot;&gt;#&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once you start reading and writing, it all compounds into something much more, something greater. It all piles up to wisdom, to self-discovery and to attain a sense of tranquility and wisdom. Your writings are your life from a bird’s eye view, captured into pages, like the webbed information on the Internet. They are your thoughts, your belongings and you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-finding&quot; tabindex=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;the finding &lt;a class=&quot;header-anchor&quot; href=&quot;https://moisentinel.github.io/blog/p/on-discovery/#the-finding&quot;&gt;&lt;span aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot; class=&quot;header-anchor__symbol&quot;&gt;#&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I feel much “able” and happy when I write, even though I acquired this knack very recently. I believe that, &lt;em&gt;the discovery of oneself is one of the most important and profound findings that one can have in one&#39;s lifetime.&lt;/em&gt; And the craziest thing is that it never stops, and we’re constantly discovering something new about ourselves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But above all, we should celebrate this sense of change and growth and cultivate a habit of recognizing ourselves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-influence&quot; tabindex=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;the influence &lt;a class=&quot;header-anchor&quot; href=&quot;https://moisentinel.github.io/blog/p/on-discovery/#the-influence&quot;&gt;&lt;span aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot; class=&quot;header-anchor__symbol&quot;&gt;#&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;screen-reader-only&quot;&gt;Direct link to this section&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to Robin Waldun [1],&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;We are what we are because of multiple complex influences, many of whom we are not aware of.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When we surround ourselves with the things that we love and are good for our upbringing, we are investing in ourselves. We are making sure a better version of ourselves. That is how we &lt;em&gt;create&lt;/em&gt; ideas in us, and those very ideas are our identity, the certitude of our individuality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Little by little we’ll build ourselves. And soon, after many years, we’ll begin to notice; a profound &lt;em&gt;change&lt;/em&gt;. A cause of nature and oneself, after which one will try to move past it and do it all over again, without hesitation. &lt;strong&gt;A new perception, a new you and a new world.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

a person with a compulsive habit or obsessive dependency on something.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Looking back a year ago, or maybe even a few months, I could have been classified a junkie. Not your usual drug addict, but your friendly neighbourhood dopamine junkie. Far worse, far more dangerous.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What is this ‘idiosyncratic era’ that I am talking about? This idiosyncratic era is formed off our self-indulgence, lack of self-awareness and the sameness that comes with it. This era developed from the idiosyncratic generation that the internet brought us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-idiosyncrasy&quot; tabindex=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;the idiosyncrasy &lt;a class=&quot;header-anchor&quot; href=&quot;https://moisentinel.github.io/blog/p/the-idiosyncratic-era/#the-idiosyncrasy&quot;&gt;&lt;span aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot; class=&quot;header-anchor__symbol&quot;&gt;#&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The peculiarity lies within itself. Our perception of time has changed, along with our attention span and our sense of clarity. This is because of this age’s natural social and technical advancements which is leading us to a hedonistic world like in Huxley’s &lt;em&gt;Brave New World&lt;/em&gt;, where it is a dystopia disguised in a form of a utopia; lacking of thought, individuality, making us paralysed from the mind and soul.[1] In contrast, the world in Orwell’s &lt;em&gt;1984&lt;/em&gt; seems less terrifying.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&quot;perception-and-rituals&quot; tabindex=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;Perception and Rituals &lt;a class=&quot;header-anchor&quot; href=&quot;https://moisentinel.github.io/blog/p/the-idiosyncratic-era/#perception-and-rituals&quot;&gt;&lt;span aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot; class=&quot;header-anchor__symbol&quot;&gt;#&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;screen-reader-only&quot;&gt;Direct link to this section&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to Byung-Chul Han, in his book &lt;em&gt;The Scent of Time,&lt;/em&gt; the modern individual is in a state of a &lt;em&gt;temporal crisis&lt;/em&gt;. We’re in a constant rush of things and are unable to catch up to ourselves. There’s no “wiggle room” for us, as we’ve filled all our time with events just to keep us busy.[2]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;The reason they are so disposed, however, is that they are preoccupied with living, not with living well.”&lt;br /&gt;
-Aristotle in &lt;em&gt;Politics&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We now associate living well with being busy. But we’re busy without any conclusion. A mindless rush, which gives no sense of completion, and we end up dissatisfied.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have to pause. We have to adapt to rituals that take enough time for us to stop drifting across: synchronise ourselves with the asynchronous routines that stop the rush and have certain &lt;em&gt;thresholds&lt;/em&gt; for which we work to reach. And these &lt;em&gt;thresholds&lt;/em&gt; give us the idea of what we need to do. These have vanished in this modern world, where we have the freedom of choice to do anything.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It is not the absence of ties, but ties themselves that set us free.”&lt;br /&gt;
-Byung-Chul Han in &lt;em&gt;The Scent of Time&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you feel that time is flying by fast, and you end up disappointed, get away from the exploitative nature of automation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fc32627ed-6f74-47e6-a1dd-116477fbaee6_564x596.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&quot;where-does-all-our-time-go%3F&quot; tabindex=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Where does all our time go?&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a class=&quot;header-anchor&quot; href=&quot;https://moisentinel.github.io/blog/p/the-idiosyncratic-era/#where-does-all-our-time-go%3F&quot;&gt;&lt;span aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot; class=&quot;header-anchor__symbol&quot;&gt;#&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;screen-reader-only&quot;&gt;Direct link to this section&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The modern individual, especially teenagers, spends his time mindlessly scrolling social media and the Internet. But why that is so?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eva Illouz says, in her book &lt;em&gt;Why Love Hurts: A Sociological Explanation,&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“[The Internet] is positioning the modern individual as a desiring subject, longing for experiences, daydreaming about objects or forms of life, and living experiences in an imaginary and virtual mode.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This age of high-information faces as a hindrance to our curiosity, creativity and imagination. I mean, if we can get &lt;em&gt;everything&lt;/em&gt;, by doing &lt;em&gt;nothing&lt;/em&gt;, who wouldn’t choose to live that way? And in the modern age, the social media feeds and streaming recommendations let you achieve just that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Consumer culture, in this way, proves as a medium to kill our imagination [3] as we keep getting more and more recommendations and ads and what not. All without lifting a finger.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Capitalism, and the rise of use of AI and technology is leading to illiteracy, and a lack of clarity (remember &lt;em&gt;Brave New World?&lt;/em&gt; Does it seem familiar?). The cognitive ease that modern systems evoke, makes it much easier to get trapped. Because our brain is a lazy, spoilt brat. Once it tastes bliss, it doesn’t want to let go.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are living in the inevitable phase of the internet [4]. One can only hope that people get bored from all this, and eventually change their course of life. &lt;em&gt;Zeitgeist&lt;/em&gt; is always changing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&quot;%E2%80%9Cbut-there-is-a-good-side-of-the-internet-too!%E2%80%9D&quot; tabindex=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;“But there is a good side of the internet too!” &lt;a class=&quot;header-anchor&quot; href=&quot;https://moisentinel.github.io/blog/p/the-idiosyncratic-era/#%E2%80%9Cbut-there-is-a-good-side-of-the-internet-too!%E2%80%9D&quot;&gt;&lt;span aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot; class=&quot;header-anchor__symbol&quot;&gt;#&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;screen-reader-only&quot;&gt;Direct link to this section&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If there wasn’t, I wouldn’t have been writing here. Millions of writers, content creators and researchers need the Internet. But this is the creator culture, not the consumer culture (&lt;a href=&quot;https://open.substack.com/pub/gurwinder/p/the-perils-of-audience-capture?r=2wqx7m&amp;amp;utm_campaign=post&amp;amp;utm_medium=web&quot;&gt;which has its own cons&lt;/a&gt;). It’s the modern consumer who should be more careful (&lt;em&gt;maybe we can argue about this point?)&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s a curse and a boon, no doubt. Maybe many of us still use it for good and well-defined purposes. I probably never would have been a reader, or a writer, if it wasn’t for the Internet. Nevertheless, the distractions seep into our day-to-day lives. Without permission. How do we solve this?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;going-to-the-other-side&quot; tabindex=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;going to the other side &lt;a class=&quot;header-anchor&quot; href=&quot;https://moisentinel.github.io/blog/p/the-idiosyncratic-era/#going-to-the-other-side&quot;&gt;&lt;span aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot; class=&quot;header-anchor__symbol&quot;&gt;#&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;screen-reader-only&quot;&gt;Direct link to this section&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How much are you willing to sacrifice for your future?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The time you spend mindlessly scrolling this and that and those, could have been used for your better future (although the example doesn’t only apply to scrolling). Perhaps you could learn a new skill, work on a project, spend time with family.&lt;br /&gt;
The solution is to &lt;strong&gt;delay the gratification process&lt;/strong&gt;, and producing obstacles to increase the friction between you and the things that are distracting you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“An idle mind is a dangerous mind”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because of this idleness, we like to see ourselves distracted. But with &lt;em&gt;what&lt;/em&gt; we are distracted is not always very productive. Instead, &lt;strong&gt;add more to your plate&lt;/strong&gt;, though make sure that it is something that you like and which serves a purpose.[5]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The most coherent solution, however, is to live a &lt;strong&gt;digitally minimal&lt;/strong&gt; life. Cal Newport, Professor of Computer Science at Georgetown University, captures this area insightfully in his &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.goodreads.com/en/book/show/40672036&quot;&gt;book&lt;/a&gt;. Reducing our dependency on technology inevitably leads to the end of the overstimulation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&quot;memento-mori&quot; tabindex=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;Memento Mori &lt;a class=&quot;header-anchor&quot; href=&quot;https://moisentinel.github.io/blog/p/the-idiosyncratic-era/#memento-mori&quot;&gt;&lt;span aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot; class=&quot;header-anchor__symbol&quot;&gt;#&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;screen-reader-only&quot;&gt;Direct link to this section&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Stoic philosophers lived by the code of “do your best, because clock’s ticking”. And they lived pretty well for most of their lives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The value of attentiveness varies in proportion to its object. You’re better off not giving the small things more time than they deserve.”&lt;br /&gt;
-Marcus Aurelius in &lt;em&gt;Meditations, 4.32&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Analyse what you&#39;ve been wasting your time on and get a hold of yourself. Stop slipping by.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In reality, it&#39;s hard and tiresome. But you&#39;d be doing your future self a favour. And you can expect changes within months. Maybe it&#39;s just the thing that can save us. Pausing, thinking, and taking enough time to live well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thank you for reading Vision of Life. If this post was valuable to you in any way, spread the word!&lt;/p&gt;

          It is so sad that we do not study for fun, to learn, but to score marks in our exams, compete and get a job. Is this what we were made for?

        <content xml:lang="en" type="html">&lt;p&gt;It is so sad that we do not study for fun, to learn, but to score marks in our exams, compete and get a job. &lt;strong&gt;Is this what we were made for?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
When’s the last time that you actually sat down to study, not because you had exams to prepare for, but because &lt;strong&gt;you actually liked it?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;why-goals-are-slowing-us-down&quot; tabindex=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;why goals are slowing us down &lt;a class=&quot;header-anchor&quot; href=&quot;https://moisentinel.github.io/blog/p/we-re-not-studying-for-fun/#why-goals-are-slowing-us-down&quot;&gt;&lt;span aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot; class=&quot;header-anchor__symbol&quot;&gt;#&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;screen-reader-only&quot;&gt;Direct link to this section&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have noticed that we perform better, when we don’t have a goal and just do things because we like it. But nowadays, we’re becoming mindless as if part of a hive mind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Blinded by the expectations, the environment and influenced by the “ideal” life that is passed on by the society, we have &lt;strong&gt;stopped pondering&lt;/strong&gt; the truths about this world, about why things happen as the way they do, and why can’t we do things that we like. We don’t read for passion, for knowledge, for gaining a vision. We read it because we have to and get some good scores.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We&#39;re simply sucking the fun out of it. We have made our life a Kafkaesque story.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Intellectual adventures turn into intellectual labour.”&lt;br /&gt;
- &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://open.substack.com/pub/amugofinsights/p/how-schools-trained-us-to-hate-reading?r=2wqx7m&amp;amp;utm_campaign=post&amp;amp;utm_medium=web&quot;&gt;Robin Waldun&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;spite-and-us&quot; tabindex=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;spite and us &lt;a class=&quot;header-anchor&quot; href=&quot;https://moisentinel.github.io/blog/p/we-re-not-studying-for-fun/#spite-and-us&quot;&gt;&lt;span aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot; class=&quot;header-anchor__symbol&quot;&gt;#&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;screen-reader-only&quot;&gt;Direct link to this section&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Remind yourself of the time when you sought out to clean your room, but then your parent comes and asks you to do it. Then what happens? &lt;strong&gt;Out of spite,&lt;/strong&gt; we don’t clean our room.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What I am trying to say in this post is similar. But in our case, we don’t deliberately refuse to do the thing. We do it, and get much less satisfaction out of it, and reduce our potential productiveness. But what if, what if we didn’t have a particular goal in mind, no external interference distorting the transmission to ourselves? Could we have succeeded far more than we do now?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What if, we actually loved our work or study&lt;/strong&gt;, but we don’t know that because &lt;strong&gt;we lived our whole life this way. How could we have known that things could be any different?&lt;/strong&gt; We are taught things merely for scoring in exams, and we are not shown the bigger picture. No wonder we suffer from identity crisis. ^235d26&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;If you love doing the thing, you are going to excel at it either way. Let’s make sure you do that.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;%E2%80%9Cthis-is-too-unrealistic.%E2%80%9D&quot; tabindex=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;“this is too unrealistic.” &lt;a class=&quot;header-anchor&quot; href=&quot;https://moisentinel.github.io/blog/p/we-re-not-studying-for-fun/#%E2%80%9Cthis-is-too-unrealistic.%E2%80%9D&quot;&gt;&lt;span aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot; class=&quot;header-anchor__symbol&quot;&gt;#&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;screen-reader-only&quot;&gt;Direct link to this section&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the most part, I agree that it is &lt;strong&gt;idealistic&lt;/strong&gt;. But why can’t we stop for a moment and think why we’re actually doing the thing. Why we are studying? Is it because we need to get a job? But are we enjoying the process? Are we getting something out of it? &lt;strong&gt;Shouldn’t our prime goal be to become a good human?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But, you can’t love everything and every subject which you are supposed to study. &lt;strong&gt;Then what do you do?&lt;/strong&gt; Do you just give up if you don’t like it? Well, I might contradict my own opinion here, but,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&amp;quot;Don&#39;t seek for everything to happen as you wish it would, but rather wish that everything happens as it actually will- then your life will flow well.&amp;quot;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;-&lt;strong&gt;Epictetus&lt;/strong&gt;, Enchiridion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You can’t always get everything.&lt;/strong&gt; I know because I have to do things that I don’t want to do too. But then how are you actually going to endure? By searching for something, some aspect of that particular topic and embracing it. Loving that very bit and being grateful for the knowledge that you gain by it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;That’s the point, isn’t it? Gaining knowledge and grow?&lt;/strong&gt; (Also, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.oxford-royale.com/articles/10-ways-fun-study/&quot;&gt;this&lt;/a&gt; might help)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;making-the-best-out-of-it.&quot; tabindex=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;making the best out of it. &lt;a class=&quot;header-anchor&quot; href=&quot;https://moisentinel.github.io/blog/p/we-re-not-studying-for-fun/#making-the-best-out-of-it.&quot;&gt;&lt;span aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot; class=&quot;header-anchor__symbol&quot;&gt;#&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;screen-reader-only&quot;&gt;Direct link to this section&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apart from everything, our main motive should be to make the best out of it. Human life is trivial, small and very, very &lt;strong&gt;brief&lt;/strong&gt;. Why should we NOT take a moment for ourselves and learn.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;There’s still time. Make sure you love the work you do, and don’t forget to gain something out of it and create something good.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
