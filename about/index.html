<h2 id="tl%3Bdr" tabindex="-1">TL;DR <a class="header-anchor" href="#tl%3Bdr"><span aria-hidden="true" class="header-anchor__symbol">#</span></a></h2>
<p>I am a junior high-schooler from India who thrives to learn new things, improve everyday and <strong>create</strong> good stuff. I love autonomy.</p>
<p>I am interested in <a href="/blog/p/another-renaissance">polymathy</a> + autodidactism, <a href="/blog/t/philosophy/">philosophy</a>, <a href="/blog/math/">math</a>, <a href="https://run.nibirsan.org/gh">open-source</a> among many. I love talking to new people, playing music, reading, writing and making stuff in my free time..</p>
<h2 id="now" tabindex="-1">Now <a class="header-anchor" href="#now"><span aria-hidden="true" class="header-anchor__symbol">#</span></a></h2>
<p>September and October have been quite interesting. I mostly worked on learning about AI Safety/Research, getting my laptop fixed, exams (and recuperating from it), and making better habits. I also posted a few blogs and videos, and went halfway through the Oxford General Philosophy <a href="https://github.com/moiSentineL/oxford-general-philosophy-2009">Course</a></p>
<p>And, I will mainly focus on getting done with my half-yearly exams (a lot of credit is on stake), and improving my Financial Literacy and marketing skills; something that I have been wanting to do since a long time. I am also planning to do some hobby projects like making some app, improving my guitar skills and making a <a href="https://run.nibirsan.org/podcast">podcast</a>.</p>
<p>Meditation streak: 97 days, as of writing this. Made a habit of reading before bed and going through Anki after meals. Also committing myself to a Reading Day every month, where I read (and finish) a book all day.</p>
<p>Lately, I have been obsessed with coffee, pencils and music for no reason.</p>

<h2 id="this-year" tabindex="-1">This year <a class="header-anchor" href="#this-year"><span aria-hidden="true" class="header-anchor__symbol">#</span></a></h2>
<p>My main goals for this year are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Becoming a knowledge worker- consume, consolidate, create.</li>
<li>Creating content- this blog, <a href="https://visionoflife.substack.com/">newsletter</a>, <a href="https://youtube.com/@nibirsankar">YouTube</a> and <a href="/pantheon/">podcast</a>.</li>
<li>Getting more fit- health = wealth.</li>
<li>Spending more time with friends and family, and developing new connections</li>
<li>Becoming more confident- spread out and face fears, carpe diem.</li>
</ul>

<p>The question of my existence is as absurd as the existence of the afternoon coffee in my mug. But yes, I do have a certain personality, which is hard to describe on paper. I will try my best.</p>
<p>I am that guy who is fueled by curiosity. I often need a &quot;challenge&quot; and hence I always try to learn something new. I like the idea of helping people, even though they can be jerks at times (I am sorta aligned to Stoicism). I want to transcend beyond the norms, and do things that <em>actually matter.</em></p>
<p>I love my work ethic and my process of creation. I tend to be workaholic sometimes, and love my work (apart from meaningless school stuff).</p>
<p>You can read about my beliefs <a href="/beliefs/">here</a>, although it is very, very incomplete.</p>
<p>Few of my blogs that display some of my personality:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://moisentinel.github.io/blog/p/i-am-an-addict">I am an addict</a>- a poem I wrote in my native language</li>
<li><a href="https://moisentinel.github.io/blog/p/why-do-i-study">why do I study?</a></li>
<li><a href="https://moisentinel.github.io/blog/p/when-you-have-metamorphosised">when you have metamorphosised</a></li>
</ul>
<p>I also love working on productivity and cognition systems: Obsidian, Spaced Repetition, workflows, AI, etc.<br>
I can also help you reach out to people that knows things beyond my understanding (I have a few friends whom I count on, for their <em>expert</em> guidance).</p>

<p>I am a self-taught guitarist, programmer, musician. I know and speak several languages: Assamese (Native), English, Hindi, Sanskrit (a bit); in that order of proficiency. An aspiring researcher; published a <a href="https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/ytwqd/">paper</a> about environment in my region.</p>
<p>I participated in YUVIKA '23 (Young Scientist Programme) held by ISRO and was a participant in ANVIKA '23 Programme hosted by Indian Institute of Space Science and Technology. I am eager to attend more programs/camps. And the goal here is to learn new things and skills that make me a better person and help me do great things for the world.</p>
