<h2 id="tl%3Bdr" tabindex="-1">TL;DR <a class="header-anchor" href="#tl%3Bdr"><span aria-hidden="true" class="header-anchor__symbol">#</span></a></h2>
<p>I am a junior high-schooler from India who thrives to learn new things, improve everyday and <strong>create</strong> good stuff. I love autonomy.</p>
<p>I am interested in <a href="/blog/p/another-renaissance">polymathy</a> + autodidactism, <a href="/blog/t/philosophy/">philosophy</a>, <a href="/blog/math/">math</a>, <a href="https://run.nibirsan.org/gh">open-source</a> among many. I love talking to new people, reading, playing music, writing and making stuff in my free time..</p>
<h2 id="now" tabindex="-1">Now <a class="header-anchor" href="#now"><span aria-hidden="true" class="header-anchor__symbol">#</span></a></h2>
<p>The start of 2025 wasn't very great. My 8-year-old pet dog passed away, my family in shambles, my relationships took a toll, I had not prepped well for my exams, and so on.</p>
<p>I managed to live through all this. I knew my responsibilities (as a son, student and a human) and I knew that I had to do them well. I knew <a href="/blog/p/notes-on-the-virtuous-life">this life was going to be hard</a>, and that's why I tried doing my best. Thankfully, my exams went well enough, and this month (Feb) has been much better than January. <strong>I am healing.</strong></p>
<p>I have some <a href="/about/#this-year">themes for this year</a> which I want to work on. It required a significant amount of introspection to understand what I want and what needs improving. Journaling in an <em>active</em> way helped a lot. I have understood a lot about myself and life by writing my thoughts down, and I encourage you to try it as well!</p>
<p>I am still doing the <a href="https://www.coursera.org/learn/mathematical-thinking/">course on Mathematical Thinking</a>, and it's so good that it is makes me want to pursue Discrete Math + Comp Sci for my undergrads. Though I can imagine it being <em>super</em> hard.</p>
<p>I have started a new workout routine (based on <a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/naturalbodybuilding/comments/fivvhv/the_quarantine_workout_template/">this reddit post</a>). It is completely made of bodyweight exercises. I realised I needed to step away from my previous routine (<a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/zc0uy/a_beginner_dumbbell_program_the_dumbbell_stopgap/">Dumbbell Stopgap</a>) to a more flexible and scalable one. So far so good!<br>
I've also started to eat better food and work on my diet plan. I think it is super cool and makes me feel proud about myself.</p>
<p>Some New and Old habits:</p>
<ul>
<li>Meditation Streak - 199 Days ðŸ”¥</li>
<li>Study-with-me streams on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@nibirsankar/streams">YouTube</a> (as much as I can)</li>
<li><a href="http://youtube.com/post/Ugkxi1AjYTWUxugBOT0FhWWMaHT5YttQ0D4c?si=fVkmzYZlYgx-U1FQ">Training to be ambidextrous</a></li>
<li>Reading almost everyday.</li>
</ul>
<p>Lately, I am obsessed with ThinkPads (T14 and T480!!!!), <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCfQgsKhHjSyRLOp9mnffqVg">fitness</a> and study plans.</p>
<p><em>Last Updated: Feb 13, 2025</em></p>
<h2 id="this-year" tabindex="-1">This year <a class="header-anchor" href="#this-year"><span aria-hidden="true" class="header-anchor__symbol">#</span></a></h2>
<p>My main themes for this year are:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Work</strong>: Focusing on both formal education and self education</li>
<li><strong>Health</strong>: Creating better systems
<ul>
<li>via habits, ritualisation and tracking</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Relationships</strong>: Accepting family responsibilities and be closer to parents</li>
<li><strong>Personal Growth</strong>: Seeking the virtuous life
<ul>
<li>imo &quot;virtuous&quot; = stoicism + minimalism + prioritisation + absurdism)</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Goals and Habits for each theme will be implemented on Quarterly and Weekly basis. The themes are inspired by Stoicism and the want to improve myself and how I handle things.</p>
<h2 id="no-but%2C-who-are-you-exactly%3F" tabindex="-1">No but, who are you exactly? <a class="header-anchor" href="#no-but%2C-who-are-you-exactly%3F"><span aria-hidden="true" class="header-anchor__symbol">#</span></a></h2>
<p>The question of my existence is as absurd as the existence of the afternoon coffee in my mug. I mean, why <em>should</em> it happen?</p>
<p>I am someone who likes thinking <em>very</em> much. I love dwelling on philosophical questions and deriving overcomplicated, mathematical solutions to day-to-day problems (like choosing which soap I should buy). Just Kidding! Although it does seem like that when I throw terms like &quot;confirmation bias&quot; or &quot;statistical base-rate&quot; around.</p>
<p>I think of myself as curious. I like doing a lot of things: learning new things, math, reading, philosophy, livestreaming, making music and videos, writing and the list goes on. <strong>But there's only one end goal. That is, to do something that actually matters, to create <em>meaningful</em> stuff.</strong></p>
<p>I love my work ethic and the process of creation and the endorphins it releases, though I can be a <em>bit</em> workaholic and ambitious at times.</p>
<p>My philosophy is inspired by:</p>
<ul>
<li>Stoicism</li>
<li>Rationality</li>
<li>Digital Minimalism</li>
<li>Doing things that matter</li>
<li>James Scholz (my idol)</li>
</ul>
<p>I appreciate updating my beliefs and trying to improve myself. I also love building better systems using Anki/SRS, Obsidian and other productivity tools/techniques. I am a memory and psychology enthusiast.</p>
<p>I value deep and genuine connections with people. I am very much interested in meeting new people.</p>
<p>So, <strong>I am a scholar, a builder and a person who improves everyday</strong>.</p>

<p>I am a self-taught guitarist, programmer, musician. I know and speak several languages: Assamese (Native), English, Hindi and Sanskrit (a bit), in that order of proficiency. Published a <a href="https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/ytwqd/">paper</a> about the <em>environment</em> in my region.</p>
<p>I participated in YUVIKA '23 (Young Scientist Programme) held by ISRO and was a participant in ANVIKA '23 Programme hosted by Indian Institute of Space Science and Technology.</p>
<p>Attended NYAS Junior Academy Fall '24 and yada yada. More on my <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/nibirsankar">LinkedIn</a>.</p>

<p>I am not a very <em>reachable</em> person. Anyone who knows me personally would know that this is normal behavior.</p>
<p>But don't fear! If you like what I am doing, or want to talk about something <strong>interesting</strong>, drop a DM or an email:</p>
