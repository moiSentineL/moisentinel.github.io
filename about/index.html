<h2 id="tl%3Bdr" tabindex="-1">TL;DR <a class="header-anchor" href="#tl%3Bdr"><span aria-hidden="true" class="header-anchor__symbol">#</span></a></h2>
<p>I am a junior high-schooler from India who thrives to learn new things, improve everyday and <strong>create</strong> good stuff. I love autonomy.</p>
<p>I am interested in <a href="/blog/p/another-renaissance">polymathy</a> + autodidactism, <a href="/blog/t/philosophy/">philosophy</a>, <a href="/blog/math/">math</a>, <a href="https://run.nibirsan.org/gh">open-source</a> among many. I love talking to new people, playing music, reading, writing and making stuff in my free time..</p>
<h2 id="now" tabindex="-1">Now <a class="header-anchor" href="#now"><span aria-hidden="true" class="header-anchor__symbol">#</span></a></h2>
<p>After my exams ended in November, I fell in a deep productivity rut. <a href="https://visionoflife.substack.com/p/being-stuck-in-a-rut-is-not-fine">It wasn't nice</a>. I am back at square one, but I have one advantage: more experience than my previous self, and I think that will help me become a better human (something like the game Hades).</p>
<p>So, I have been <a href="https://fatebook.io/q/will-i-reach-20h-deep-work-week-by-the--cm4qqi21l0000fm0rdho6fvgr">trying to improve my focus</a> and getting back my curiosity. Scholzian Resilience helps a lot. I am also waking up a bit early these days, and trying to sleep early (the latter is hard, given my workaholism). I am also doing study-with-me livestreams on my <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@nibirsankar">YouTube channel</a> (at 2pm IST and 7pm IST) to be more accountable for my actions. Do join my streams. Let's study together ðŸ”¥</p>
<p>I had to leave the philosophy <a href="https://github.com/moiSentineL/oxford-general-philosophy-2009">course</a> I was doing because I couldn't make time for it, and there was very little reading material. So, I couldn't follow after a certain point. But thankfully I found a <a href="https://www.coursera.org/learn/mathematical-thinking/">course on Mathematical Thinking</a> (as of writing this, I am on Week 1). I am especially enjoying the abstract-ness of mathematics. Formal Logic feels like a bridge between philosophy and math, and boy I am liking it! (mathematical masochism).</p>
<p>If you're interested in math, and or philosophy, I would love to have a chat with you. Please <a href="#okay%2C-you-seem-cool-enough%2C-where-can-i-reach-you%3F">reach out</a>!</p>
<p>Some New and Old Habits:</p>
<ul>
<li>Meditation Streak - 145 Days ðŸ”¥</li>
<li>Waking up at 7am</li>
<li>Tracking Focus and Energy levels after Deep Work Sessions.</li>
<li>Using <a href="https://fatebook.io/">fatebook.io</a> to track decisions.</li>
<li>Regular doses of coffee (starting ~9am, max 2pm)</li>
<li>Using <a href="https://vihaansondhi.substack.com/p/cron-for-the-mind">Anki as Reading List</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Lately, I've been obsessed with <a href="https://github.com/moiSentineL/dotfiles">Linux</a>, A7X, <a href="https://github.com/moiSentineL/Tomato.C">productivity tools</a> for no reason.</p>
<p><em>Last Updated: December 24, 2024</em></p>
<h2 id="this-year" tabindex="-1">This year <a class="header-anchor" href="#this-year"><span aria-hidden="true" class="header-anchor__symbol">#</span></a></h2>
<p>My main goals for this year are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Becoming a knowledge worker- consume, consolidate, create.</li>
<li>Creating content- this blog, <a href="https://visionoflife.substack.com/">newsletter</a>, <a href="https://youtube.com/@nibirsankar">YouTube</a> and <a href="/pantheon/">podcast</a>.</li>
<li>Getting more fit- health = wealth.</li>
<li>Spending more time with friends and family, and developing new connections</li>
<li>Becoming more confident- spread out and face fears, carpe diem.</li>
</ul>

<p>The question of my existence is as absurd as the existence of the afternoon coffee in my mug. But yes, I do have a certain personality, which is hard to describe on paper. I will try my best.</p>
<p>I am that guy who is fueled by curiosity. I often need a &quot;challenge&quot; and hence I always try to learn something new. I like the idea of helping people, even though they can be jerks at times (I am sorta aligned to Stoicism). I want to transcend beyond the norms, and do things that <em>actually matter.</em></p>
<p>I love my work ethic and my process of creation. I tend to be workaholic sometimes, and love my work (apart from meaningless school stuff).</p>
<p>Few of my blogs that display some of my personality:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://moisentinel.github.io/blog/p/i-am-an-addict">I am an addict</a>- a poem I wrote in my native language</li>
<li><a href="https://moisentinel.github.io/blog/p/why-do-i-study">why do I study?</a></li>
<li><a href="https://moisentinel.github.io/blog/p/when-you-have-metamorphosised">when you have metamorphosised</a></li>
</ul>
<p>I also love working on productivity and cognition systems: Obsidian, Spaced Repetition, workflows, AI, etc.<br>
I can also help you reach out to people that knows things beyond my understanding (I have a few friends whom I count on, for their <em>expert</em> guidance).</p>
<h3 id="flexing-(i-don't-do-that-anymore)" tabindex="-1">Flexing (i don't do that anymore) <a class="header-anchor" href="#flexing-(i-don't-do-that-anymore)"><span aria-hidden="true" class="header-anchor__symbol">#</span></a></h3>
<p>I am a self-taught guitarist, programmer, musician. I know and speak several languages: Assamese (Native), English, Hindi, Sanskrit (a bit); in that order of proficiency. An aspiring researcher; published a <a href="https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/ytwqd/">paper</a> about environment in my region.</p>
<p>I participated in YUVIKA '23 (Young Scientist Programme) held by ISRO and was a participant in ANVIKA '23 Programme hosted by Indian Institute of Space Science and Technology. I am eager to attend more programs/camps. And the goal here is to learn new things and skills that make me a better person and help me do great things for the world.</p>
<h2 id="okay%2C-you-seem-cool-enough%2C-where-can-i-reach-you%3F" tabindex="-1">Okay, you seem cool enough, where can I reach you? <a class="header-anchor" href="#okay%2C-you-seem-cool-enough%2C-where-can-i-reach-you%3F"><span aria-hidden="true" class="header-anchor__symbol">#</span></a></h2>
<p>I am not a very <em>reachable</em> person. Anyone who knows me personally would know that this is normal behavior.</p>
<p>But don't fear! If you like what I am doing, or want to talk about something <strong>interesting</strong>, drop a DM or an email:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="mailto:nibir@nibirsan.org">Email</a> (preferred)</li>
<li>Discord- <code>@moisentinel</code></li>
</ul>
