<h2 id="tl%3Bdr" tabindex="-1">TL;DR <a class="header-anchor" href="#tl%3Bdr"><span aria-hidden="true" class="header-anchor__symbol">#</span></a></h2>
<p>I am a junior high-schooler from India who thrives to learn new things, improve everyday and <strong>create</strong> good stuff. I love autonomy.</p>
<p>I am interested in <a href="/blog/p/another-renaissance">polymathy</a> + autodidactism, <a href="/blog/t/philosophy/">philosophy</a>, <a href="/blog/math/">math</a>, <a href="https://run.nibirsan.org/gh">open-source</a> among many. I love talking to new people, reading, playing music, writing and making stuff in my free time..</p>
<h2 id="now" tabindex="-1">Now <a class="header-anchor" href="#now"><span aria-hidden="true" class="header-anchor__symbol">#</span></a></h2>
<p>After my exams ended in November, I fell in a deep productivity rut. <a href="https://visionoflife.substack.com/p/being-stuck-in-a-rut-is-not-fine">It wasn't nice</a>. I am back at square one, but I have one advantage: more experience than my previous self, and I think that will help me become a better human (something like the game Hades).</p>
<p>So, I have been <a href="https://fatebook.io/q/will-i-reach-20h-deep-work-week-by-the--cm4qqi21l0000fm0rdho6fvgr">trying to improve my focus</a> and getting back my curiosity. Scholzian Resilience helps a lot. I am also waking up a bit early these days, and trying to sleep early (the latter is hard, given my workaholism). I am also doing study-with-me livestreams on my <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@nibirsankar">YouTube channel</a> (at 2pm IST and 7pm IST) to be more accountable for my actions. Do join my streams. Let's study together ðŸ”¥</p>
<p>I had to leave the philosophy <a href="https://github.com/moiSentineL/oxford-general-philosophy-2009">course</a> I was doing because I couldn't make time for it, and there was very little reading material. So, I couldn't follow after a certain point. But thankfully I found a <a href="https://www.coursera.org/learn/mathematical-thinking/">course on Mathematical Thinking</a> (as of writing this, I am on Week 1). I am especially enjoying the abstract-ness of mathematics. Formal Logic feels like a bridge between philosophy and math, and boy I am liking it! (mathematical masochism).</p>
<p>If you're interested in math, and or philosophy, I would love to have a chat with you. Please <a href="#okay%2C-you-seem-cool-enough%2C-where-can-i-reach-you%3F">reach out</a>!</p>
<p>Some New and Old Habits:</p>
<ul>
<li>Meditation Streak - 145 Days ðŸ”¥</li>
<li>Waking up at 7am</li>
<li>Tracking Focus and Energy levels after Deep Work Sessions.</li>
<li>Using <a href="https://fatebook.io/">fatebook.io</a> to track decisions.</li>
<li>Regular doses of coffee (starting ~9am, max 2pm)</li>
<li>Using <a href="https://vihaansondhi.substack.com/p/cron-for-the-mind">Anki as Reading List</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Lately, I've been obsessed with <a href="https://github.com/moiSentineL/dotfiles">Linux</a>, A7X, <a href="https://github.com/moiSentineL/Tomato.C">productivity tools</a> for no reason.</p>
<p><em>Last Updated: December 24, 2024</em></p>
<h2 id="this-year" tabindex="-1">This year <a class="header-anchor" href="#this-year"><span aria-hidden="true" class="header-anchor__symbol">#</span></a></h2>
<p>My main themes for this year are:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Work</strong>: Focusing on both formal education and self education</li>
<li><strong>Health</strong>: Creating better systems
<ul>
<li>via habits, ritualisation and tracking</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Relationships</strong>: Accepting family responsibilities and be closer to parents</li>
<li><strong>Personal Growth</strong>: Seeking the virtuous life
<ul>
<li>imo &quot;virtuous&quot; = stoicism + minimalism + prioritisation + absurdism)</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Goals and Habits for each theme will be implemented on Quarterly and Weekly basis. The themes are inspired by Stoicism and the want to improve myself and how I handle things.</p>
<h2 id="no-but%2C-who-are-you-exactly%3F" tabindex="-1">No but, who are you exactly? <a class="header-anchor" href="#no-but%2C-who-are-you-exactly%3F"><span aria-hidden="true" class="header-anchor__symbol">#</span></a></h2>
<p>The question of my existence is as absurd as the existence of the afternoon coffee in my mug. I mean, why <em>should</em> it happen?</p>
<p>I am someone who likes thinking <em>very</em> much. I love dwelling on philosophical questions and deriving overcomplicated, mathematical solutions to day-to-day problems (like choosing which soap I should buy). Just Kidding! Although it does seem like that when I throw terms like &quot;confirmation bias&quot; or &quot;statistical base-rate&quot; around.</p>
<p>I think of myself as curious. I like doing a lot of things: learning new things, math, reading, philosophy, livestreaming, making music and videos, writing and the list goes on. <strong>But there's only one end goal. That is, to do something that actually matters, to create <em>meaningful</em> stuff.</strong></p>
<p>I love my work ethic and the process of creation and the endorphins it releases, though I can be a <em>bit</em> workaholic and ambitious at times.</p>
<p>My philosophy is inspired by:</p>
<ul>
<li>Stoicism</li>
<li>Rationality</li>
<li>Digital Minimalism</li>
<li>Doing things that matter</li>
<li>James Scholz (my idol)</li>
</ul>
<p>I appreciate updating my beliefs and trying to improve myself. I also love building better systems using Anki/SRS, Obsidian and other productivity tools/techniques. I am a memory and psychology enthusiast.</p>
<p>I value deep and genuine connections with people. I am very much interested in meeting new people.</p>
<p>So, <strong>I am a scholar, a builder and a person who improves everyday</strong>.</p>

<p>I am a self-taught guitarist, programmer, musician. I know and speak several languages: Assamese (Native), English, Hindi and Sanskrit (a bit), in that order of proficiency. Published a <a href="https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/ytwqd/">paper</a> about the <em>environment</em> in my region.</p>
<p>I participated in YUVIKA '23 (Young Scientist Programme) held by ISRO and was a participant in ANVIKA '23 Programme hosted by Indian Institute of Space Science and Technology.</p>
<p>Attended NYAS Junior Academy Fall '24 and yada yada. More on my <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/nibirsankar">LinkedIn</a>.</p>

<p>I am not a very <em>reachable</em> person. Anyone who knows me personally would know that this is normal behavior.</p>
<p>But don't fear! If you like what I am doing, or want to talk about something <strong>interesting</strong>, drop a DM or an email:</p>
